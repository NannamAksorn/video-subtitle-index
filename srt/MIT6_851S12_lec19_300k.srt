00:00:20,485 --> 00:00:22,860
PROFESSOR: So today we're
going to cover a data structure

10
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:24,240
called link-cut trees.

11
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:27,300
A cool way of maintaining
dynamic trees,

12
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:29,910
and it begins our study
of dynamic graphs.

13
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:32,850
Where in general, we have
a graph usually undirected.

14
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:35,710
You want to support insertion
and deletion of edges.

15
00:00:35,710 --> 00:00:38,970
So we're going to do that in
the situation where at all times

16
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:40,190
our graphs are trees.

17
00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:42,420
So in general, we
have a forest of trees

18
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:44,440
and we want to maintain them.

19
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:49,229
So that will be our only
data structure today

20
00:00:49,229 --> 00:00:50,520
because it's a bit complicated.

21
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:53,370
It's going to need some
fancy amortization.

22
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:56,880
And two techniques
for splitting trees

23
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:58,650
into paths, one
we've seen already

24
00:00:58,650 --> 00:01:00,570
in the context of tango
trees and lecture's

25
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:02,514
six, preferred paths.

26
00:01:02,514 --> 00:01:03,930
And another, which
we haven't seen

27
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:07,200
is probably my favorite
technique in data structures,

28
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,847
actually, heavy
like decomposition.

29
00:01:09,847 --> 00:01:12,180
The technique and data structure
that I've used the most

30
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:14,120
outside of data structures.

31
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:16,111
It's very useful in
lots of settings.

32
00:01:16,111 --> 00:01:17,610
Whenever you have
an unbalanced tree

33
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:22,720
and you want to make it balance,
like with like cut trees,

34
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:25,030
It's the go to tool.

35
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:29,955
So, in, general we want to
maintain a forest of trees.

36
00:01:29,955 --> 00:01:37,740


37
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:41,515
And these are going to be
rooted unordered trees.

38
00:01:41,515 --> 00:01:45,270


39
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:47,650
So arbitrary degree I this.

40
00:01:47,650 --> 00:01:50,700


41
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:53,070
And we have a bunch of
operations we want to do.

42
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:55,650
Basically, insertion and
deletion of edges and some

43
00:01:55,650 --> 00:01:57,060
queries.

44
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:59,340
And we want to do all
of those operations

45
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:00,990
in the log n time per operation.

46
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:04,980


47
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:06,780
That's the hard part.

48
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:12,360
So we have some kind of getting
started operation make tree.

49
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:17,430
This is going to be make a new
vertex in a new tree, return.

50
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:18,040
It.

51
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:20,700
So this is how you add
notes to the structure.

52
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:23,160
And we're not going to
worry about doing deletions.

53
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:26,744
Once you add something
it stays there forever.

54
00:02:26,744 --> 00:02:28,035
So you could you could do that.

55
00:02:28,035 --> 00:02:29,570
It's no big deal.

56
00:02:29,570 --> 00:02:31,650
You could throw away a tree.

57
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:33,350
Then we have link
which is essentially

58
00:02:33,350 --> 00:02:35,790
the insertion of an edge.

59
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:39,030
So here we're given
two vertices BMW

60
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:42,540
that are in different
trees as a precondition.

61
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:46,590
So v has to be at
the root of its tree.

62
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:48,870
W can be any node.

63
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:53,580
So here we have another tree
and we have some node w inside v

64
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:59,760
And the link operation
adds V as a child of W.

65
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:03,530
So we add this edge.

66
00:03:03,530 --> 00:03:06,889
OK, that, of course, combines
two trees into one tree.

67
00:03:06,889 --> 00:03:09,180
And the requirement is BMW
has to be in different trees

68
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:10,888
or otherwise you'd be
adding a cycle that

69
00:03:10,888 --> 00:03:15,710
doesn't satisfy that were
always a forest of trees.

70
00:03:15,710 --> 00:03:23,340
Then we have a cut operation,
which is basically the reverse.

71
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:25,260
So let me draw it.

72
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:30,090
We have V subtree parent.

73
00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:33,120
And there is a
whole tree up here.

74
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:36,130


75
00:03:36,130 --> 00:03:40,350
And what we want to do
is remove that edge.

76
00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:43,590
So that splits one tree into
two trees by the leading

77
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:44,970
edge from V to its parent.

78
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:54,800


79
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:57,570
OK so those are our updates.

80
00:03:57,570 --> 00:04:01,830
Pretty obvious in the
setting of dynamic graphs.

81
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:04,690
Of course, it's the
first time we see them.

82
00:04:04,690 --> 00:04:05,812
Now we have some queries.

83
00:04:05,812 --> 00:04:07,270
There are lots of
different queries

84
00:04:07,270 --> 00:04:09,940
that cut-trees can support.

85
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:18,430
One of the most basic is
find the root of vertex.

86
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:19,750
Let me just draw a picture of.

87
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:24,460
It you have some
vertex V, you want

88
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:27,360
to return the root of the tree.

89
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:34,160
So find R. And that's
pretty easy to do.

90
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:38,570
Well actually see it in
next class, next lecture,

91
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:40,940
if you wanted to make
tree/link cut and find root,

92
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:44,450
there's a really easy way to
do them in logarithmic time.

93
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:47,090
link-cut trees is a harder
way to do it in log n time,

94
00:04:47,090 --> 00:04:49,710
but they support a lot
of other operations.

95
00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:59,020
And in particular, something
called path aggregation.

96
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:04,420
This is kind of the essence
of link/cut are cool.

97
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:07,790
Let's suppose you
have a for a tree,

98
00:05:07,790 --> 00:05:13,210
you have a vertex V.
There's a root to V path.

99
00:05:13,210 --> 00:05:15,850
And let's suppose that every
node or every edge, doesn't

100
00:05:15,850 --> 00:05:17,530
matter, has a weight on it.

101
00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:19,700
Just some real number.

102
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:22,150
Then path aggregation
can do things

103
00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:27,850
like the min or
the max or the sum

104
00:05:27,850 --> 00:05:31,705
or the product or whatever
of weights on that path.

105
00:05:31,705 --> 00:05:41,102


106
00:05:41,102 --> 00:05:42,310
And this is a powerful thing.

107
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:44,768
And it's actually the reason
link/cut trees were originally

108
00:05:44,768 --> 00:05:47,110
invented for doing network
flow algorithms faster.

109
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:49,519
If you know network
flow algorithms.

110
00:05:49,519 --> 00:05:51,560
Or maybe you've seen them
in advanced algorithms.

111
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:53,440
This is sort of the key
thing you need to do.

112
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:58,270
You find, I think, min way
edge along one of these paths

113
00:05:58,270 --> 00:06:01,170
and that's the max you can push
in a push reliable strategy.

114
00:06:01,170 --> 00:06:03,670
I don't want to get into that
because that's algorithms, not

115
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:05,000
data structures.

116
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,670
But this is why
they were invented.

117
00:06:06,670 --> 00:06:11,230
And, in general, link/cut
trees have a very strong kind

118
00:06:11,230 --> 00:06:12,652
of path thing.

119
00:06:12,652 --> 00:06:14,360
If you want to know
anything about a root

120
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:18,100
to the path for any
node v, link-cut trees

121
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:20,030
can do whatever you
want in lon n time.

122
00:06:20,030 --> 00:06:22,310
This is just sort of
an example of that.

123
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:24,750
And Yeah.

124
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:25,290
course.

125
00:06:25,290 --> 00:06:27,370
So that's what link
countries are able to do.

126
00:06:27,370 --> 00:06:31,060
All these operations in log
n And the main point here

127
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:34,540
is that the trees are storing
are probably not balanced.

128
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:38,120
It could be a path,
could be depth

129
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:41,770
and is this path we're talking
about could be length order

130
00:06:41,770 --> 00:06:44,320
n is really bad.

131
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:46,704
And yet, we can do all these
operations in log n time.

132
00:06:46,704 --> 00:06:48,370
And we're going to
do that, essentially,

133
00:06:48,370 --> 00:06:52,240
by storing the unbalanced
tree that you're

134
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:57,010
trying to represent, which we
call this the represent tree.

135
00:06:57,010 --> 00:07:00,430
We're going to store it using,
essentially, a balanced tree.

136
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:01,870
In one version of
link-cut trees,

137
00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:06,180
indeed, we store all the
nodes in a log n height tree.

138
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:08,380
The version we're
going to cover here--

139
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:10,600
there's several versions
of link-cut trees.

140
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:15,580
Original are biased
later in Tarjan in 1983.

141
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:18,520
And then Tarjan wrote a
book, one of a few books

142
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:19,750
on data structures.

143
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:23,980
Very thin book, usually called
Tarjan's little book, in 1984.

144
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:26,160
And it has a different
version of link-cut trees,

145
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,576
and that's the
version we're going

146
00:07:27,576 --> 00:07:29,609
to cover it uses splay
trees as a subroutine.

147
00:07:29,609 --> 00:07:31,400
So it's not going to
be perfectly balanced.

148
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:33,930
It's going to be balanced
in an amortize sense,

149
00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:38,320
or vaguely balanced,
roughly balanced, whatever.

150
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:41,530
But there is a version that does
everything in log n worse case

151
00:07:41,530 --> 00:07:42,130
pre-operation.

152
00:07:42,130 --> 00:07:45,850
If there's time, I'll sketch
that for you at the end.

153
00:07:45,850 --> 00:07:50,260
But the simplest version I know
is this splay tree version.

154
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:55,120
And it's also kind of fun
because the version we'll see,

155
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,950
doesn't really look
like it should work,

156
00:07:56,950 --> 00:08:01,550
and yet it does thanks to
splay trees, essentially.

157
00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:03,970
So it's a little, it's fun
and surprising in that sense.

158
00:08:03,970 --> 00:08:15,610


159
00:08:15,610 --> 00:08:20,214
As I said, link-cut trees are
all about paths in the tree.

160
00:08:20,214 --> 00:08:22,380
And so somehow we want to
split a tree up into paths

161
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:24,210
and we've already
seen a way to do this.

162
00:08:24,210 --> 00:08:26,290
The preferred path
decomposition.

163
00:08:26,290 --> 00:08:29,970
So it's kind of reminding
you, but I'm also

164
00:08:29,970 --> 00:08:33,230
going to slightly redefine
it, if I recall correctly.

165
00:08:33,230 --> 00:08:38,209
It's just a minor
difference which

166
00:08:38,209 --> 00:08:39,669
I can talk about a second.

167
00:08:39,669 --> 00:08:42,900
The notion of a preferred
child of a node, and it's

168
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:43,875
going to be two cases.

169
00:08:43,875 --> 00:08:47,770


170
00:08:47,770 --> 00:08:53,960
There isn't a preferred
child, if the last access

171
00:08:53,960 --> 00:09:04,020
in these subtree is v. So
we have some node v. Now,

172
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:07,430
this is relative to
the represented tree.

173
00:09:07,430 --> 00:09:10,260
So we have some node to v.
We don't care about accesses

174
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:13,350
outside of that subtree, but
of the last access within

175
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:17,730
the subtree was v itself, then
there's no preferred child.

176
00:09:17,730 --> 00:09:20,220
Otherwise, the last
access within the tree

177
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:22,900
was in one of these
child subtrees.

178
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:25,980
And whichever one it was, we
say w is the preferred child.

179
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:29,020


180
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:42,091
So if the last access in
v subtree is in child w's

181
00:09:42,091 --> 00:09:42,590
subtree.

182
00:09:42,590 --> 00:09:45,430


183
00:09:45,430 --> 00:09:47,630
OK, I think last time we
defined preferred children

184
00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:50,930
in the context of tango trees,
we just had the second part.

185
00:09:50,930 --> 00:09:53,330
So if there is an access
to v, we ignored it

186
00:09:53,330 --> 00:09:55,460
and we just consider what
the last child access.

187
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:57,470
Was I don't think
there's actually

188
00:09:57,470 --> 00:09:59,120
would affect tango
trees, but I think

189
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,440
it does effect Link-cut trees.

190
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:02,180
So I want to define it this way.

191
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:05,390
It'll make life
cleaner, basically.

192
00:10:05,390 --> 00:10:08,210
Probably not a huge
difference either way.

193
00:10:08,210 --> 00:10:09,980
OK, once you have
preferred children,

194
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:13,250
that gives you one outgoing
edge, downward edge,

195
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:14,720
from every node.

196
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:21,620
And so we get preferred
paths by repeatedly following

197
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:23,090
preferred child pointers.

198
00:10:23,090 --> 00:10:27,250
Now, we may stop at some
point because we reach a none.

199
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:31,610
I'm going to use none as like
null pointers in this lecture.

200
00:10:31,610 --> 00:10:34,910
But, in general, we have some
tree and you follow for a while

201
00:10:34,910 --> 00:10:38,450
and then it's going to be a
bunch of things like this.

202
00:10:38,450 --> 00:10:49,430
We decompose the nodes
and the represented tree,

203
00:10:49,430 --> 00:10:50,460
partition the nodes.

204
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:54,350


205
00:10:54,350 --> 00:10:57,110
Every node belongs to
some preferred path.

206
00:10:57,110 --> 00:11:00,770
So basic idea is we're
going to store the preferred

207
00:11:00,770 --> 00:11:05,720
paths in kind of balanced binary
search trees, splay trees,

208
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:08,330
and then we're going to connect
them together because that's

209
00:11:08,330 --> 00:11:10,770
not all the edges in the tree.

210
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:15,810
There's some edges that
sort of connect them,

211
00:11:15,810 --> 00:11:16,970
connect the paths together.

212
00:11:16,970 --> 00:11:19,670
That's where the
tree part comes in.

213
00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:22,700
That's what we're going to do
it this thing is unbalanced.

214
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:25,190
We're going to take each
of these white lines

215
00:11:25,190 --> 00:11:28,190
and compress it
into a splay tree,

216
00:11:28,190 --> 00:11:29,590
and preserve the red pointers.

217
00:11:29,590 --> 00:11:33,721


218
00:11:33,721 --> 00:11:37,090
I'll write that down.

219
00:11:37,090 --> 00:11:41,350
These are called
auxiliary trees.

220
00:11:41,350 --> 00:11:44,760
This was exactly the
idea and tango trace

221
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:48,310
and I'm using tango
tree terminology

222
00:11:48,310 --> 00:11:50,880
to keep it consistent
with that notation.

223
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:54,700
It wasn't called preferred paths
in the link-cut tree papers.

224
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:58,270
Or it wasn't called auxiliary
trees, but same difference.

225
00:11:58,270 --> 00:12:06,940
So auxiliary trees were going to
store represent each preferred

226
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:16,380
path by a splay tree.

227
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:21,079
Tango trees we use
red-black trees or whatever.

228
00:12:21,079 --> 00:12:22,662
Could us splay trees,
actually, if you

229
00:12:22,662 --> 00:12:25,540
use tango trees with splay
trees for each preferred path.

230
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:27,650
It's called a multi-splay tree.

231
00:12:27,650 --> 00:12:31,020
Multi-splay trees are almost
identical to link-cut trees

232
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:32,770
but, they're used for
a different setting.

233
00:12:32,770 --> 00:12:37,380
The use for proving
log n competitiveness.

234
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:40,210
Here we're doing it to
represent a specific tree.

235
00:12:40,210 --> 00:12:43,420
With tango trees, the
tree we're representing

236
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:45,190
was just a perfect
binary tree, p.

237
00:12:45,190 --> 00:12:48,179
So you may recall, here
it has some meaning.

238
00:12:48,179 --> 00:12:49,720
And it's going to
be changing, and we

239
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:53,060
care about how it's changing.

240
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:57,520
OK, another difference is
we're going to key the nodes

241
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:59,290
by depth.

242
00:12:59,290 --> 00:13:02,844
This is what we wanted
to do with tango trees,

243
00:13:02,844 --> 00:13:04,510
but we weren't allowed
to because we had

244
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:05,676
to be a binary search trees.

245
00:13:05,676 --> 00:13:07,420
And the keys were given to us.

246
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:08,650
Here, there are no keys.

247
00:13:08,650 --> 00:13:11,320
So we need to specify them
and the most convenient one

248
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:12,530
is by depth.

249
00:13:12,530 --> 00:13:19,790
So we're just taking a path
like this, 0, 1, 2, 3 4.

250
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:23,470
And then we're turning it
into a nice balance tree

251
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:33,430
like this, 0, 1, 2, 3, 3, 4.

252
00:13:33,430 --> 00:13:38,080
OK, Now, it's a splay
trees so it's not

253
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:40,270
guaranteed to be
balanced at any moment,

254
00:13:40,270 --> 00:13:45,670
but amortized is going to have
log n performance preparation.

255
00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:48,280
OK, and then this
is sort of that's

256
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:49,990
representing each of
these white paths,

257
00:13:49,990 --> 00:13:52,040
but then we also need
the red pointers.

258
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:55,360
So what we're going
to do is say the root

259
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:59,140
of each auxiliary
tree, I'll abbreviate

260
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:08,410
ox tree, stores what I'll
call the path parent, which

261
00:14:08,410 --> 00:14:11,080
are these red pointers.

262
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:25,240
The definition is this is, the
paths, the top nodes, parent,

263
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:26,650
and represented tree.

264
00:14:26,650 --> 00:14:33,220


265
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:36,760
OK, very soon it's
going to get confusing

266
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:38,710
and I'm going to always
make it explicit.

267
00:14:38,710 --> 00:14:40,780
Am I talking about the
represented tree the thing

268
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:42,670
we're trying to represent?

269
00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:46,690
Or am I talking about auxiliary
trees because notion of parent

270
00:14:46,690 --> 00:14:48,700
is different in the two?

271
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:50,770
So in an auxiliary
tree a parent is just

272
00:14:50,770 --> 00:14:54,010
whatever it happens to be
stored in the splay tree.

273
00:14:54,010 --> 00:14:56,710
When you splay operations
you care about those parents.

274
00:14:56,710 --> 00:14:59,830
When you're thinking
about the tree you're

275
00:14:59,830 --> 00:15:01,870
trying to represent,
you care about parents

276
00:15:01,870 --> 00:15:03,680
in the represented tree.

277
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:04,930
Now, how do you see that here?

278
00:15:04,930 --> 00:15:09,124
Well following parent is like
doing predecessor over here.

279
00:15:09,124 --> 00:15:10,790
So we kind of know
how to do predecessor

280
00:15:10,790 --> 00:15:12,480
in a binary search tree.

281
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:16,060
But when we get to 0,
which is the left most

282
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:20,170
node in this tree, corresponds
to the top of the path,

283
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:24,130
if we want to do the parent
that's going up from this path,

284
00:15:24,130 --> 00:15:26,580
that's going to be
the path parent.

285
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:28,930
And it saying the
path's top node,

286
00:15:28,930 --> 00:15:32,620
that's this guy 0, its parent
and the representative tree

287
00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:34,240
are just going to
store that pointer.

288
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:35,290
The only weird
thing is we're not

289
00:15:35,290 --> 00:15:37,090
going to store the
pointer here, we're

290
00:15:37,090 --> 00:15:40,420
going to store the pointer here.

291
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:41,410
That's the path parent.

292
00:15:41,410 --> 00:15:43,750
We're going to put it at
the root of the splay tree,

293
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:45,166
basically because
it's really easy

294
00:15:45,166 --> 00:15:46,510
to get to the root of a tree.

295
00:15:46,510 --> 00:15:48,400
You could probably
start here, you just

296
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:51,180
have to go left every time
and it's kind of annoying.

297
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:52,900
Analysis will get messier.

298
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:54,940
So we'll put at the root.

299
00:15:54,940 --> 00:15:56,890
And so, in particular,
if I do a rotation,

300
00:15:56,890 --> 00:15:59,740
like if I rotate the tree like
this and make one the route,

301
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:01,840
that path parent pointer
has to move to 1.

302
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:03,580
But it's still
representing essentially

303
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:05,680
for this whole splay
tree representing

304
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:10,340
this path, what was the
parent pointer from there.

305
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:13,690
So this is the represented
tree, and this is the ox tree.

306
00:16:13,690 --> 00:16:16,600


307
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:20,290
OK, now if I take all the
ox trees plus these parent

308
00:16:20,290 --> 00:16:25,180
pointers, I get something
called the tree of ox trees.

309
00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:30,760


310
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:34,450
And this is our representation.

311
00:16:34,450 --> 00:16:37,180
So there's the represented
thing versus our representation.

312
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:39,471
I'm not going to use the word
representation because it

313
00:16:39,471 --> 00:16:41,200
sounds almost like represented.

314
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:44,350
So it's going to be represented
versus tree of ox trees.

315
00:16:44,350 --> 00:16:45,940
Tree of ox trees
is what we store,

316
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:48,670
represented is what
we want to store.

317
00:16:48,670 --> 00:16:51,700
That's what we're
trying to represent.

318
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:57,160
So that's the
terminology, Basically, we

319
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:59,080
want the tree of ox
trees to be balanced,

320
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:01,413
and if there's splay trees,
they'll be kind of balanced.

321
00:17:01,413 --> 00:17:04,390


322
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:08,119
Whereas, the represented
tree is on balance.

323
00:17:08,119 --> 00:17:10,990
Cool so now I want
to give you some code

324
00:17:10,990 --> 00:17:13,201
and how we're going to
manipulate these things.

325
00:17:13,201 --> 00:17:14,950
And then we'll be able
to analyze the code

326
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:17,619
and that both will
take a little while.

327
00:17:17,619 --> 00:17:42,871


328
00:17:42,871 --> 00:17:44,620
The main operation I'm
going to talk about

329
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:47,050
is actually just a
helper operation.

330
00:17:47,050 --> 00:17:52,820
So first I want to tell you
what it is, how it works.

331
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:56,530
It's like an access
in a tango tree.

332
00:17:56,530 --> 00:18:00,100
With tango trees we just
wanted to touch item xi

333
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:02,316
and then go onto the
next item, xi plus 1.

334
00:18:02,316 --> 00:18:03,940
So I'm going to think
about that world,

335
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:06,275
while all I'm trying
to do is touch nodes.

336
00:18:06,275 --> 00:18:07,900
What's interesting
about touching nodes

337
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:12,590
is it changes this notion
of preferred edges.

338
00:18:12,590 --> 00:18:14,830
So, as I said, the last
access in that subtree

339
00:18:14,830 --> 00:18:16,340
was blah, blah, blah.

340
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:17,110
So access.

341
00:18:17,110 --> 00:18:19,690


342
00:18:19,690 --> 00:18:21,550
In reality, what I
mean is the last time

343
00:18:21,550 --> 00:18:26,560
that node was used as a link
or cut or find operation.

344
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:28,660
But in fact I'm going
to make that explicit.

345
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:31,630
Every operation is going to
start by calling this function

346
00:18:31,630 --> 00:18:33,850
access on its arguments.

347
00:18:33,850 --> 00:18:35,602
Question?

348
00:18:35,602 --> 00:18:37,498
AUDIENCE: I still
don't understand.

349
00:18:37,498 --> 00:18:41,710
When you say that this
[INAUDIBLE] by depth--

350
00:18:41,710 --> 00:18:42,646
PROFESSOR: Yes.

351
00:18:42,646 --> 00:18:44,229
AUDIENCE: How do you
go from that path

352
00:18:44,229 --> 00:18:45,930
to the actual splay tree?

353
00:18:45,930 --> 00:18:49,160
PROFESSOR: OK so the
transformation from this path

354
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:50,950
in the represented
tree to splay tree

355
00:18:50,950 --> 00:18:55,750
is just these nodes have
depth within that path,

356
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:57,850
I mean they're just
stored along the path.

357
00:18:57,850 --> 00:19:00,580
What I mean is, I want to store
them in as a binary search

358
00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:03,390
tree ordered by that value.

359
00:19:03,390 --> 00:19:06,100
So that's what-- yeah.

360
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:08,420
So splay trees have
some key on the nodes,

361
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:10,430
they maintain the binary
search tree property.

362
00:19:10,430 --> 00:19:11,971
My key is just going
to be the depth.

363
00:19:11,971 --> 00:19:13,144
The position along the path.

364
00:19:13,144 --> 00:19:15,352
AUDIENCE: So if you do an
in order traversal you just

365
00:19:15,352 --> 00:19:15,880
get the path.

366
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:17,410
PROFESSOR: Right if I do
it in order traversal here,

367
00:19:17,410 --> 00:19:18,830
I'll get the path back.

368
00:19:18,830 --> 00:19:22,750
Yep, no problem.

369
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:24,830
That's going to be
important to understand.

370
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:29,600
OK, so to do an access, access
is going to do two things.

371
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,930
The first thing it has to
do, and the other thing

372
00:19:31,930 --> 00:19:35,500
is going to make our
life easy, you'll

373
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:39,080
see once we've defined access,
all operations become trivial.

374
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:41,530
So it's going to be a
really cool helper function.

375
00:19:41,530 --> 00:19:46,580


376
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:49,570
The first thing we have to
do, when we access a node v,

377
00:19:49,570 --> 00:19:53,230
is say well that then by
definition the path to v from

378
00:19:53,230 --> 00:19:57,937
the root --v to root I guess,
sort of, but probably more root

379
00:19:57,937 --> 00:19:58,672
to v--

380
00:19:58,672 --> 00:20:03,010


381
00:20:03,010 --> 00:20:03,940
should be preferred.

382
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:05,440
That's the definition
of preferred

383
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:07,231
because now it's the
latest thing accessed.

384
00:20:07,231 --> 00:20:11,859


385
00:20:11,859 --> 00:20:12,900
So we've got to fix that.

386
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:15,265


387
00:20:15,265 --> 00:20:16,890
But we're going to
do a little bit more

388
00:20:16,890 --> 00:20:24,530
we're also going to make
v the root of its ox tree.

389
00:20:24,530 --> 00:20:30,270


390
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:33,060
Which will mean, because
that ox tree is now

391
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:36,900
the top most ox tree because
that actually contains the root

392
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:43,830
and it contains v. So
in fact, v is the root

393
00:20:43,830 --> 00:20:45,520
of the tree of ox trees.

394
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:54,420
It's the overall root for
this tree of our streets.

395
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:55,300
Why do we do that?

396
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:58,047
Well, it's sort of going to
just be a consequence of using

397
00:20:58,047 --> 00:20:59,880
splay, because whenever
you splice something

398
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:04,020
you move it to the root
in this zigzaggy way.

399
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:07,200
But it will actually be really
helpful to have this property,

400
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:11,450
and that's why these are the
simplest link-cut trees I know.

401
00:21:11,450 --> 00:21:15,300
OK, so how do we do this?

402
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:18,840
So you're given the node
v somewhere in this world,

403
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:21,480
and we've basically got to
fix a lot of preferred child

404
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:23,892
pointers.

405
00:21:23,892 --> 00:21:25,350
And, whereas, tango
trees basically

406
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:30,420
walked from the top down,
navigating one preferred path

407
00:21:30,420 --> 00:21:32,070
until it found the
right place to exit

408
00:21:32,070 --> 00:21:35,220
and then fixing that edge, were
going to be working bottom up.

409
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:38,010
Because we already know where
the vertexes, were given it,

410
00:21:38,010 --> 00:21:41,280
and we need to walk our way
up the tree and kind of push

411
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:43,620
v to the root overall.

412
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:50,040
So the first thing
to do is splay v. So

413
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:56,990
that, now, when I say splay
v, I mean within its ox tree.

414
00:21:56,990 --> 00:22:00,650
Doesn't make sense to do
it in any global sense.

415
00:22:00,650 --> 00:22:04,060
In some sense access is going to
be our global version of splay.

416
00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:06,900
Whenever I say splay a node, I
mean just within its ox tree.

417
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:08,900
That's going to be the
definition of splay tree.

418
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:12,380
So you may recall from Lecture
Six there's the zig-zig case

419
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:13,290
and zig-zag case.

420
00:22:13,290 --> 00:22:16,470
You do some rotation,
double rotation, whatever.

421
00:22:16,470 --> 00:22:18,840
In the end, maybe one
more rotation, and then v

422
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:20,772
becomes the root.

423
00:22:20,772 --> 00:22:22,230
So what does the
picture look like?

424
00:22:22,230 --> 00:22:25,260
We've got v at the
root of it's ox tree.

425
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:27,060
Then we've got things
in the left subtree

426
00:22:27,060 --> 00:22:29,461
which have smaller depth.

427
00:22:29,461 --> 00:22:31,710
And then we've got things
in the right subtree of tree

428
00:22:31,710 --> 00:22:34,260
which have bigger depth.

429
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:38,620
Depth bigger than v. So we
just pulled to the root.

430
00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:43,350
So in the represented tree
what we have is a path v. These

431
00:22:43,350 --> 00:22:46,210
are things of smaller depth
these things of larger depth.

432
00:22:46,210 --> 00:22:50,100
Now, if you look at the
definition of preferred child,

433
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:54,480
when we access v, v now no
longer has a preferred child.

434
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,945
This preferred
child is now none.

435
00:22:56,945 --> 00:22:58,320
If you look at
this picture, this

436
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:02,650
is a preferred path, currently,
v has a preferred child.

437
00:23:02,650 --> 00:23:03,870
We want to get rid of that.

438
00:23:03,870 --> 00:23:06,270
That's our first operation.

439
00:23:06,270 --> 00:23:09,330


440
00:23:09,330 --> 00:23:12,390
First thing we want to do
is get rid of that edge.

441
00:23:12,390 --> 00:23:15,460
It's no longer a preferred edge.

442
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:19,670
So that essentially
corresponds to this edge

443
00:23:19,670 --> 00:23:22,040
because that's the connection
from v to deeper things.

444
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:24,800
I mean in fact, this
node right below us

445
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:29,530
let's call it x is right here.

446
00:23:29,530 --> 00:23:31,880
It's the smallest
depth among the nodes

447
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:33,860
with larger depth than v.

448
00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:36,080
But if we kind of
kill that connection,

449
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:39,720
then, now, this path is its
own thing, the part below v,

450
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:42,120
separate from v and above.

451
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:44,210
So that's what we're
going to do first.

452
00:23:44,210 --> 00:23:49,340
Remove these preferred child.

453
00:23:49,340 --> 00:23:53,510


454
00:23:53,510 --> 00:23:56,092
And I'm going to elaborate
exactly the point arithmetic

455
00:23:56,092 --> 00:23:57,050
that makes that happen.

456
00:23:57,050 --> 00:23:59,720


457
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:03,770
This is the kind of tedious
part of, or really any point

458
00:24:03,770 --> 00:24:05,140
of machine data structure.

459
00:24:05,140 --> 00:24:07,640
This is going to all work on a
point of machine, by the way.

460
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:25,710


461
00:24:25,710 --> 00:24:29,860
OK, so basically I'm
obliterating the edge.

462
00:24:29,860 --> 00:24:35,770
So I'm going to make this
vertex here, have a path parent

463
00:24:35,770 --> 00:24:41,920
pointer to v and otherwise
obliterate this edge.

464
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:45,160
It will no longer has a parent,
v no longer has a right child.

465
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:50,680
So it's going to be v has a
left thing and no right pointer.

466
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:55,485
But this separate tree is
going to a parent pointer to v.

467
00:24:55,485 --> 00:24:56,860
This is, of course,
if it exists.

468
00:24:56,860 --> 00:25:01,690
If v.right is nothing already,
then you don't do any of this.

469
00:25:01,690 --> 00:25:04,457
But if there is a right pointer
then you've got to do this.

470
00:25:04,457 --> 00:25:06,040
So this is the place
where we're going

471
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:09,044
to set path parents,
pretty obvious stuff.

472
00:25:09,044 --> 00:25:10,960
The only thing to check
is that this is really

473
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:11,751
in the right place.

474
00:25:11,751 --> 00:25:15,760
This thing is the root
of this ox tree, which

475
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:18,790
is where the parent pointer
path parent supposed to be,

476
00:25:18,790 --> 00:25:22,450
and it points to v meaning,
that the parent of x

477
00:25:22,450 --> 00:25:24,220
is v in the represented tree.

478
00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:25,930
And that's exactly
what this picture is.

479
00:25:25,930 --> 00:25:29,410
This is the represented
tree parent of x is v,

480
00:25:29,410 --> 00:25:32,990
and so that's the correct
definition of pat parent.

481
00:25:32,990 --> 00:25:34,650
Cool.

482
00:25:34,650 --> 00:25:37,740
OK, now the fun part.

483
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:42,419


484
00:25:42,419 --> 00:25:43,960
Now, we're going to
walk up the tree.

485
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:46,891


486
00:25:46,891 --> 00:25:49,390
We've seen everything on the
outline except this heavy light

487
00:25:49,390 --> 00:25:50,640
decomposition.

488
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:51,820
We'll come to that soon.

489
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:57,480


490
00:25:57,480 --> 00:26:01,900
OK, so now we're going
to walk up the tree

491
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:05,710
and add new preferred
child pointers.

492
00:26:05,710 --> 00:26:09,070
This is the one that we
had to remove because it's

493
00:26:09,070 --> 00:26:12,940
the stuff below v. But up the
path, if we walk up to the root

494
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:16,060
here, to the left
most node of v then

495
00:26:16,060 --> 00:26:17,530
there's a path
parent from there,

496
00:26:17,530 --> 00:26:21,330
we want to make that not a path
parent but a regular parent.

497
00:26:21,330 --> 00:26:23,500
Because that right
now, is living

498
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:25,690
in its own little
preferred path that we

499
00:26:25,690 --> 00:26:29,230
want that preferred path to
extend all the way to the root,

500
00:26:29,230 --> 00:26:33,050
by the definition of a
child after doing an access.

501
00:26:33,050 --> 00:26:42,940
So we're going to do a loop
until v path parent is none.

502
00:26:42,940 --> 00:26:48,800


503
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:52,950
I'm going to let w
be v's path parent.

504
00:26:52,950 --> 00:26:57,470


505
00:26:57,470 --> 00:26:59,700
save some writing.

506
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:02,170
And then we're going to splay w.

507
00:27:02,170 --> 00:27:05,540
OK, I think at this point,
I should draw a picture.

508
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:15,020
So many pictures to draw.

509
00:27:15,020 --> 00:27:21,610
So we have, let's say, a
node w as a child v. This

510
00:27:21,610 --> 00:27:25,120
is the represented tree.

511
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:30,370
That's some other child x
and I can have many children.

512
00:27:30,370 --> 00:27:34,060
Let's suppose that, right now,
the preferred child from w

513
00:27:34,060 --> 00:27:35,890
is x.

514
00:27:35,890 --> 00:27:38,560
It's not v because we just
followed a path parent pointer

515
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:42,940
to go from v's path, which is
something here, to w's path.

516
00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:45,850
So w's path is going to
be something like this.

517
00:27:45,850 --> 00:27:48,490
So it goes to some
other guy x, we

518
00:27:48,490 --> 00:27:51,610
want change that that pointer.

519
00:27:51,610 --> 00:27:56,160
Instead of being that,
we want to go here.

520
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:58,000
That's in the represented tree.

521
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:03,610
Now what does this look like
in the tree of ox trees?

522
00:28:03,610 --> 00:28:05,340
W lives in some thing.

523
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:09,760


524
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:14,260
w's there, x's its
successor in there,

525
00:28:14,260 --> 00:28:19,720
so maybe it's like a
right child or whatever,

526
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:21,250
somewhere else in the tree.

527
00:28:21,250 --> 00:28:24,210
And then separately we've
already built this thing.

528
00:28:24,210 --> 00:28:28,210
v it has a left child, it has
no right child because there's

529
00:28:28,210 --> 00:28:32,680
nothing deeper than v in
its own preferred path.

530
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:35,950
And then we have a path parent
pointer that goes like this.

531
00:28:35,950 --> 00:28:40,070


532
00:28:40,070 --> 00:28:40,860
I want to fix.

533
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:42,860
That the first thing I'm
going to do is splay w,

534
00:28:42,860 --> 00:28:46,070
so the w is in the
root of its own tree.

535
00:28:46,070 --> 00:28:50,480
So then it's going
to look like w.

536
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:54,110
It's going to have a left child,
left subtree, right subtree.

537
00:28:54,110 --> 00:28:56,360
X is going to be its
successor so it's

538
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:58,640
the leftmost thing in there.

539
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:06,020
And we still have v with its
left child and this pointer.

540
00:29:06,020 --> 00:29:07,110
It's not in the tree.

541
00:29:07,110 --> 00:29:10,250
So if two ox trees, now I want
to basically merge these two ox

542
00:29:10,250 --> 00:29:13,880
trees, but also get
rid of this stuff.

543
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:15,350
Just like we did
up here actually.

544
00:29:15,350 --> 00:29:18,620
First, I have to destroy
this preferred child

545
00:29:18,620 --> 00:29:20,780
and then make a new
one, which is v.

546
00:29:20,780 --> 00:29:21,530
So how do I do it?

547
00:29:21,530 --> 00:29:23,960
I just replace the
right pointer from w

548
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:29,480
to be v instead of whatever
this thing is that's it.

549
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:42,110
So say, switch w's preferred
child to be v. And what we do

550
00:29:42,110 --> 00:29:51,440
is say w, first we clip
off the existing guy,

551
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:57,110
we say this node's w.rights path
parent is now going to be w.

552
00:29:57,110 --> 00:29:59,900
We still want to have some way
to get from here back up to w,

553
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:01,640
just like we did up here.

554
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:04,530
This code is going to look very
similar to these two lines.

555
00:30:04,530 --> 00:30:05,825
We set it's parents to none.

556
00:30:05,825 --> 00:30:09,300


557
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:13,560
And we set w.right.

558
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:15,470
Up, here we set it to none.

559
00:30:15,470 --> 00:30:18,230
Now we know it
actually needs to be v.

560
00:30:18,230 --> 00:30:19,880
And then we set
the reverse pointer

561
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:26,150
so v's parent is now w and v
no longer has a path parent.

562
00:30:26,150 --> 00:30:31,920


563
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:35,900
So essentially the reverse
of these operations.

564
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:38,450
So we remove this
preferred child pointer

565
00:30:38,450 --> 00:30:39,770
and we add this one in.

566
00:30:39,770 --> 00:30:44,840
So the new picture will be,
we have w has its left subtree

567
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:46,250
just like before.

568
00:30:46,250 --> 00:30:49,770
It's right subtree is now
v with its left subtree.

569
00:30:49,770 --> 00:30:53,210
And then we also have this
other tree hanging out.

570
00:30:53,210 --> 00:30:57,219
Not directly connected except
by path parent pointer.

571
00:30:57,219 --> 00:30:59,510
So whereas before, v was
linked in with the path parent

572
00:30:59,510 --> 00:31:01,926
pointer, now this thing is
linked to in the parent pointer

573
00:31:01,926 --> 00:31:03,680
and sort of the
primary connection,

574
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:07,670
the white connection
is direct from w to v.

575
00:31:07,670 --> 00:31:09,470
And that's exactly
what corresponds

576
00:31:09,470 --> 00:31:11,730
to clipping off this portion
of the preferred path

577
00:31:11,730 --> 00:31:16,330
and concatenating on this
portion of the preferred path.

578
00:31:16,330 --> 00:31:17,600
More or less clear?

579
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:19,450
You can double
check this at home

580
00:31:19,450 --> 00:31:23,754
but that's what we need to, do.

581
00:31:23,754 --> 00:31:25,670
To go back and forth
between these two worlds.

582
00:31:25,670 --> 00:31:28,969
The represented world
and the tree of our world

583
00:31:28,969 --> 00:31:30,010
is doing the right thing.

584
00:31:30,010 --> 00:31:34,620
Again you can check that
this path parent is, indeed,

585
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:35,410
the right thing.

586
00:31:35,410 --> 00:31:37,330
It's essentially saying
the parent of x equals

587
00:31:37,330 --> 00:31:39,890
w, which is, indeed, the case.

588
00:31:39,890 --> 00:31:45,640
That left most thing
here, its parent is w.

589
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:51,730
Cool last thing we do is
kind of a lame way to say it,

590
00:31:51,730 --> 00:31:55,360
but I want to splay v
within its ox tree Now,

591
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:56,720
v is a child of the root.

592
00:31:56,720 --> 00:32:01,290
So this just means
rotate v. So what

593
00:32:01,290 --> 00:32:05,800
it's going to look like
is v becomes the root,

594
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:10,690
it's left child is w, that
left child is whatever,

595
00:32:10,690 --> 00:32:12,330
that right child is whatever.

596
00:32:12,330 --> 00:32:15,554
V will still have no right
child because v is the deepest

597
00:32:15,554 --> 00:32:16,720
node in it's preferred path.

598
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:17,890
So there's nothing
deeper than it.

599
00:32:17,890 --> 00:32:19,510
There's nothing
to the right of v.

600
00:32:19,510 --> 00:32:22,010
So these two
triangles go to here.

601
00:32:22,010 --> 00:32:24,520
Of course, there's still the
old triangle with x in it,

602
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:27,500
and it's still going to prefer
it's still going to point to w.

603
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:30,040


604
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:31,660
But we want v to
eventually end up

605
00:32:31,660 --> 00:32:35,860
to be the very, very root so
I'd like to make the root again

606
00:32:35,860 --> 00:32:39,450
after I did this concatenation.

607
00:32:39,450 --> 00:32:43,260
And so there you go you can
think of this as a second splay

608
00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:50,170
if you want or as a
rotation, either way.

609
00:32:50,170 --> 00:32:52,040
And now we're going to loop.

610
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:54,820
OK, the one thing I
didn't make explicit

611
00:32:54,820 --> 00:32:58,870
is that when we do a splay,
or when we do a rotation,

612
00:32:58,870 --> 00:33:02,650
you have to carry along
the path parent pointer.

613
00:33:02,650 --> 00:33:05,830
So like right now,
sorry, in this picture,

614
00:33:05,830 --> 00:33:07,690
w has some path parent
pointer because it's

615
00:33:07,690 --> 00:33:09,340
the root of its ox tree.

616
00:33:09,340 --> 00:33:11,399
After we do the
rotation, v is the root

617
00:33:11,399 --> 00:33:13,690
and so it's going to have
the parent path parent point.

618
00:33:13,690 --> 00:33:18,770
Or you can just define rotate
to preserve that information.

619
00:33:18,770 --> 00:33:22,030
So now v has some new path
parent and we do the loop.

620
00:33:22,030 --> 00:33:24,650
As long as it is not
there's something there,

621
00:33:24,650 --> 00:33:27,700
we're going to splay
it stick them together.

622
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:30,490
Repeat, the number
of times we repeat,

623
00:33:30,490 --> 00:33:34,042
is equal to the number of
preferred child changes.

624
00:33:34,042 --> 00:33:36,000
So that's how we're going
to analyze the thing.

625
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:41,020
How many times does a child
have to change in this world.

626
00:33:41,020 --> 00:33:47,410
OK, clear, more or
less that is that's

627
00:33:47,410 --> 00:33:49,630
the hard the hard
operation access.

628
00:33:49,630 --> 00:33:52,960


629
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:56,290
One thing to note is v will
have no right child at the end,

630
00:33:56,290 --> 00:33:59,410
and it will be the root
of the tree of ox trees.

631
00:33:59,410 --> 00:34:01,240
Why the tree of ox trees?

632
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:03,490
When we stop, we
have no path parent.

633
00:34:03,490 --> 00:34:05,720
That means we are
the overall root.

634
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:06,610
So that's the end.

635
00:34:06,610 --> 00:34:09,570


636
00:34:09,570 --> 00:34:14,830
Cool now let me
tell you how to do--

637
00:34:14,830 --> 00:34:16,710
first, I'll do the
queries, and then I'll

638
00:34:16,710 --> 00:34:17,989
do the updates, link-cut.

639
00:34:17,989 --> 00:34:20,590
Cut Make tree, I'm pretty
sure, if you all think

640
00:34:20,590 --> 00:34:22,440
you know how did you make tree.

641
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:24,020
So let's start with find root.

642
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:28,530


643
00:34:28,530 --> 00:34:36,150
So for find root, first thing
we're going to do is access v.

644
00:34:36,150 --> 00:34:42,750
So what that gives us is v, no
right child, some left child.

645
00:34:42,750 --> 00:34:47,489
This is v's ox tree, but the
roots of the overall tree

646
00:34:47,489 --> 00:34:48,949
is right here.

647
00:34:48,949 --> 00:34:49,530
This is r.

648
00:34:49,530 --> 00:34:52,060


649
00:34:52,060 --> 00:34:54,610
Because, in the
end, we know that,

650
00:34:54,610 --> 00:34:58,150
the mean the root ox tree
always contains the root

651
00:34:58,150 --> 00:35:02,010
node of the tree, and the
access operation makes it also

652
00:35:02,010 --> 00:35:09,400
contain v So what's the highest
node in that path from r to v?

653
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:11,590
Well, it's the left
most node in the thing.

654
00:35:11,590 --> 00:35:20,650
So you just block left
to find the root r.

655
00:35:20,650 --> 00:35:24,546
And then, we are going to do
one more thing, which splay r.

656
00:35:24,546 --> 00:35:26,410
If we didn't splay
r, we'd be in trouble

657
00:35:26,410 --> 00:35:28,450
because this is a splay tree.

658
00:35:28,450 --> 00:35:32,360
If you say this r might be
extremely deep in the tree.

659
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:34,510
And so if you just repeatedly
said, find root of v,

660
00:35:34,510 --> 00:35:36,730
find v for the same
v, you don't want

661
00:35:36,730 --> 00:35:39,940
to have to walk down linear
length path every single time.

662
00:35:39,940 --> 00:35:43,870
So we're going to splay it
every time we touch the root,

663
00:35:43,870 --> 00:35:47,500
so that very soon r will be
near the root of the tree of ox

664
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:49,520
trees, and so this
operation will become fast.

665
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:52,150
So amortized it will
always be order log n.

666
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:54,970
But we need to do that.

667
00:35:54,970 --> 00:35:57,700
OK that's fine root.

668
00:35:57,700 --> 00:35:59,606
Let's do half aggregate.

669
00:35:59,606 --> 00:36:05,570


670
00:36:05,570 --> 00:36:08,440
Of aggregates
basically the same.

671
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:09,910
Actually, even easier.

672
00:36:09,910 --> 00:36:12,040
First thing we do like
all of our operations,

673
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:16,270
is access v, so we
get that picture.

674
00:36:16,270 --> 00:36:18,700
So remember what
this corresponds to?

675
00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:26,026
This is an ox tree that
represents a path ending in v

676
00:36:26,026 --> 00:36:29,860
So this is in the
represented tree.

677
00:36:29,860 --> 00:36:31,840
And the goal of a
path aggregate is

678
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:35,480
to compute the min or the max
or to some of those things.

679
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:37,450
So I basically
have this tree that

680
00:36:37,450 --> 00:36:39,970
represents exactly the
things I care about,

681
00:36:39,970 --> 00:36:43,780
and I just need to do a sum
or a min or a max or whatever.

682
00:36:43,780 --> 00:36:46,390
So easy way to do it is
augment all the ox trees

683
00:36:46,390 --> 00:36:48,640
to have subtree
size, subtree sums,

684
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:51,860
or mins or maxes, whatever
operations you care about.

685
00:36:51,860 --> 00:37:03,510
And so then it's just a return
v.subtree min max, whatever.

686
00:37:03,510 --> 00:37:08,230


687
00:37:08,230 --> 00:37:10,707
You have to have to check
when we do link-cuts

688
00:37:10,707 --> 00:37:12,790
that it's easy to maintain
augmentation like this,

689
00:37:12,790 --> 00:37:13,930
but it is.

690
00:37:13,930 --> 00:37:17,200
And now this, the
subtree aggregations

691
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:19,030
are relative to
your own ox tree.

692
00:37:19,030 --> 00:37:20,741
You don't go deeper.

693
00:37:20,741 --> 00:37:22,240
In fact, there's
no way to go deeper

694
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:24,380
because if you look
at the structure,

695
00:37:24,380 --> 00:37:25,540
there's no way to go down.

696
00:37:25,540 --> 00:37:27,100
We store these path
parents, but we

697
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:29,950
can't afford to store path
children because a node may

698
00:37:29,950 --> 00:37:32,050
have a zillion path children.

699
00:37:32,050 --> 00:37:34,600
So it's kind of
awkward to store them.

700
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:37,900
we don't have to because
this aggregation is just

701
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:38,956
within the ox tree.

702
00:37:38,956 --> 00:37:40,330
That's exactly
what we care about

703
00:37:40,330 --> 00:37:44,120
because it represents that
path and nothing more.

704
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:48,670
So you see, access makes
our life pretty darn easy.

705
00:37:48,670 --> 00:37:50,650
Once that path is preferred,
we can do whatever

706
00:37:50,650 --> 00:37:51,760
we need to with that path.

707
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:56,350
We can compute aggregations,
the root, anything pretty

708
00:37:56,350 --> 00:37:58,255
much instantly once
we have access.

709
00:37:58,255 --> 00:38:00,790


710
00:38:00,790 --> 00:38:04,240
OK, I claim also link
and cut are really easy.

711
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:08,060


712
00:38:08,060 --> 00:38:11,210
So let me show you that.

713
00:38:11,210 --> 00:38:12,230
So let's start with cut.

714
00:38:12,230 --> 00:38:16,060


715
00:38:16,060 --> 00:38:23,320
First thing we do, you
guessed it, access v. So

716
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:24,940
think about this
picture a little bit.

717
00:38:24,940 --> 00:38:28,900
So we have v, have this stuff.

718
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:31,520
What this corresponds
to, this is the ox tree

719
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:33,250
in the represented tree.

720
00:38:33,250 --> 00:38:37,090
This is a path
from the root to v.

721
00:38:37,090 --> 00:38:39,280
And our goal in
the cut operation

722
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:42,700
is to separate v from its
parent in the represented tree.

723
00:38:42,700 --> 00:38:46,840
So we want to remove this
edge above v. That basically

724
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:48,970
corresponds to this edge.

725
00:38:48,970 --> 00:38:52,210
Connection from v to all the
things less deep than it.

726
00:38:52,210 --> 00:38:53,530
So this is the preferred path.

727
00:38:53,530 --> 00:38:57,040
Of course, in reality, there
is some subtree down here,

728
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:59,990
and that's going to correspond
to things that are linked here

729
00:38:59,990 --> 00:39:02,030
by path parent pointers.

730
00:39:02,030 --> 00:39:05,410
So they'll come along for the
ride, because what they know

731
00:39:05,410 --> 00:39:09,310
is they're attached to v.
And so all we need to do

732
00:39:09,310 --> 00:39:11,650
is delete this edge
and we're done.

733
00:39:11,650 --> 00:39:17,450
It's kind of crazy,
but it works.

734
00:39:17,450 --> 00:39:27,550
So what we do, say, v
left the parent is none.

735
00:39:27,550 --> 00:39:31,870
The left is none.

736
00:39:31,870 --> 00:39:32,860
That's it.

737
00:39:32,860 --> 00:39:33,830
Gone.

738
00:39:33,830 --> 00:39:36,100
That edge has disappeared.

739
00:39:36,100 --> 00:39:40,405
What will be left with
is v all by itself.

740
00:39:40,405 --> 00:39:42,970
/ Has no left child,
no right child.

741
00:39:42,970 --> 00:39:48,070
It still has some things that
link into it via path parent

742
00:39:48,070 --> 00:39:49,940
pointers.

743
00:39:49,940 --> 00:39:56,500
But v is alone in its ox
tree after you do a cut.

744
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:59,860
This thing will now live
in a separate world.

745
00:39:59,860 --> 00:40:03,760
In particular, this node
becomes the new root

746
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:06,860
of the tree of ox
trees for this tree.

747
00:40:06,860 --> 00:40:08,770
after we do the cut,
there's two trees.

748
00:40:08,770 --> 00:40:10,150
So there's two
trees of ox trees.

749
00:40:10,150 --> 00:40:12,250
There's the one with v,
v will remain the root

750
00:40:12,250 --> 00:40:14,200
of its tree of ox trees.

751
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:17,950
And the other one,
this thing called x,

752
00:40:17,950 --> 00:40:21,720
becomes its own root of
its own tree of ox trees.

753
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:23,130
So there's nothing else to do.

754
00:40:23,130 --> 00:40:25,270
It doesn't need a parent
pointer because it's not

755
00:40:25,270 --> 00:40:28,230
linked to anything above it.

756
00:40:28,230 --> 00:40:30,910
The end.

757
00:40:30,910 --> 00:40:33,740
OK, I corresponds to
some node up here.

758
00:40:33,740 --> 00:40:34,840
Kind of the median node.

759
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:39,130


760
00:40:39,130 --> 00:40:40,550
So there you go.

761
00:40:40,550 --> 00:40:41,570
That's a cut.

762
00:40:41,570 --> 00:40:43,832
It's like super short code.

763
00:40:43,832 --> 00:40:45,290
You have to stare
at it for a while

764
00:40:45,290 --> 00:40:49,940
and make sure it does all the
right things, but it does.

765
00:40:49,940 --> 00:40:51,240
How about a link?

766
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:54,999
Well first thing we do on a
link, is access v and access w.

767
00:40:54,999 --> 00:40:56,540
These don't interfere
with each other

768
00:40:56,540 --> 00:40:59,170
because precondition
is that v and w are

769
00:40:59,170 --> 00:41:01,360
in different trees of ox trees.

770
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:04,520
They're indifferent
represented trees.

771
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:06,170
So they're completely
independent.

772
00:41:06,170 --> 00:41:08,150
The result will
be that we have--

773
00:41:08,150 --> 00:41:15,030


774
00:41:15,030 --> 00:41:18,790
should be consistent --so
ox trees are on the left.

775
00:41:18,790 --> 00:41:22,690
We're going to have w, is
going to have a left thing.

776
00:41:22,690 --> 00:41:27,010
We're going to have v claim
all by itself because remember

777
00:41:27,010 --> 00:41:28,540
what a link does?

778
00:41:28,540 --> 00:41:31,390
It's right here, v is
assumed to be a root node.

779
00:41:31,390 --> 00:41:34,030
So if you do an access
on the root node,

780
00:41:34,030 --> 00:41:36,840
then the path from the root
to v is a very short path.

781
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:38,630
It is just v itself.

782
00:41:38,630 --> 00:41:40,330
So the ox tree
containing v, will just

783
00:41:40,330 --> 00:41:46,060
be v itself when you
do x as v. Yeah, so

784
00:41:46,060 --> 00:41:50,005
this is the picture
in represented space.

785
00:41:50,005 --> 00:41:51,880
And so we access v,
we're going to have this.

786
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:53,790
Of course, there's
stuff pointing into it.

787
00:41:53,790 --> 00:41:56,770
We're at access w, so it's
going to look like this.

788
00:41:56,770 --> 00:42:00,244
And then this path is going
to be what's over here.

789
00:42:00,244 --> 00:42:01,660
And there's, of
course, more stuff

790
00:42:01,660 --> 00:42:03,880
linked from below into those.

791
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:08,050
Our goal is to add this
edge between v and w, which

792
00:42:08,050 --> 00:42:10,660
corresponds to
adding this change.

793
00:42:10,660 --> 00:42:15,050


794
00:42:15,050 --> 00:42:18,540
So that's what
we're going to do.

795
00:42:18,540 --> 00:42:20,278
V.left left equals w.

796
00:42:20,278 --> 00:42:23,086


797
00:42:23,086 --> 00:42:29,920
W.parent equals v.

798
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:34,210
If you want, you could instead
make v the right child of w.

799
00:42:34,210 --> 00:42:35,740
And that looks much more sane.

800
00:42:35,740 --> 00:42:38,390
I like it this way because
it looks kind of insane.

801
00:42:38,390 --> 00:42:39,929
This is not unbalanced
or anything.

802
00:42:39,929 --> 00:42:42,220
But splay trees will fix it
so you don't have to worry.

803
00:42:42,220 --> 00:42:45,490
This is the carefree
approach to data structuring.

804
00:42:45,490 --> 00:42:47,830
And you just leave it to
the analysis to make sure.

805
00:42:47,830 --> 00:42:52,060
Everything here is going
to be log n amortized.

806
00:42:52,060 --> 00:42:56,170
But you can check this is doing
the right thing, because v

807
00:42:56,170 --> 00:42:57,780
is deeper than w, right?

808
00:42:57,780 --> 00:43:01,250
So we had this path from
the root over here to w.

809
00:43:01,250 --> 00:43:03,884
We're extending the
path by one node, v,

810
00:43:03,884 --> 00:43:05,800
and so v should be to
the right of everything.

811
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:08,140
So either it goes that
here is that right child

812
00:43:08,140 --> 00:43:11,110
w that would also work, or
would make it the parent of w

813
00:43:11,110 --> 00:43:13,280
on the right that works.

814
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:16,750
It's in the correct order,
binary search tree order.

815
00:43:16,750 --> 00:43:18,220
OK?

816
00:43:18,220 --> 00:43:20,475
So you see length and
links and cuts are easy.

817
00:43:20,475 --> 00:43:21,850
In fact, the most
complicated was

818
00:43:21,850 --> 00:43:25,690
find root where we had
to do a walk and splay,

819
00:43:25,690 --> 00:43:28,360
but basically, everything
reduces to access.

820
00:43:28,360 --> 00:43:30,910
If access is fast,
all these operations

821
00:43:30,910 --> 00:43:33,970
will be fast because they
spend essentially constant time

822
00:43:33,970 --> 00:43:36,365
plus a constant
number of accesses.

823
00:43:36,365 --> 00:43:37,240
Except for find root.

824
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:38,290
It also doesn't splay.

825
00:43:38,290 --> 00:43:40,373
But we're going to show
displays are efficient as,

826
00:43:40,373 --> 00:43:44,010
well as part of access, because
access does a ton of splays.

827
00:43:44,010 --> 00:43:45,550
So this is log n
amortize, surely

828
00:43:45,550 --> 00:43:47,290
one splay is log n amortized.

829
00:43:47,290 --> 00:43:50,300
And indeed, that
will be the case.

830
00:43:50,300 --> 00:43:53,800
AUDIENCE: Splay as access.

831
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:56,680
PROFESSOR: Here, I'm treating
splaying not as an access.

832
00:43:56,680 --> 00:44:00,569
So I'm going to define access
to mean calling this function.

833
00:44:00,569 --> 00:44:01,976
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

834
00:44:01,976 --> 00:44:07,140


835
00:44:07,140 --> 00:44:10,250
PROFESSOR: OK so over
here, access first splays v

836
00:44:10,250 --> 00:44:11,470
and displays various things.

837
00:44:11,470 --> 00:44:13,914
It might not splay r.

838
00:44:13,914 --> 00:44:17,650
AUDIENCE: No, I'm saying, do
you call access r [INAUDIBLE]?

839
00:44:17,650 --> 00:44:19,270
PROFESSOR: Oh good.

840
00:44:19,270 --> 00:44:21,160
That might simplify my analysis.

841
00:44:21,160 --> 00:44:25,540
I'll just change this
line to access r.

842
00:44:25,540 --> 00:44:28,390
Good, why not?

843
00:44:28,390 --> 00:44:31,060


844
00:44:31,060 --> 00:44:32,980
Yeah, that seems
like a good way.

845
00:44:32,980 --> 00:44:36,400


846
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:38,350
OK, I think you could do that.

847
00:44:38,350 --> 00:44:41,410
It might simplify,
conceptually, what's going on.

848
00:44:41,410 --> 00:44:45,410
The one thing I find
annoying about it's just--

849
00:44:45,410 --> 00:44:47,050
it's an aesthetic, let's say.

850
00:44:47,050 --> 00:44:50,260
So here, I was talking
about the last access.

851
00:44:50,260 --> 00:44:53,800
And if you define lost access
to mean access, that's fine.

852
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:56,170
But also another intuitive
notion of the last access,

853
00:44:56,170 --> 00:44:59,650
is the last time it was given to
any of these functions cut link

854
00:44:59,650 --> 00:45:01,520
find root path aggregate.

855
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:03,942
And so r is not really
given to the function.

856
00:45:03,942 --> 00:45:05,650
Of course, it's the
output of find roots,

857
00:45:05,650 --> 00:45:07,840
so maybe you think
of that as an access.

858
00:45:07,840 --> 00:45:10,270
You could say find root
is accessing the root.

859
00:45:10,270 --> 00:45:13,680
Either way, this
should work either way,

860
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:15,660
but I think I like that.

861
00:45:15,660 --> 00:45:19,190
You just have to
redefine things a little.

862
00:45:19,190 --> 00:45:21,250
OK, let's do some analysis.

863
00:45:21,250 --> 00:45:22,990
This is the data structure.

864
00:45:22,990 --> 00:45:25,280
Algorithms are all up there
in they're gory detail.

865
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:25,780
This is.

866
00:45:25,780 --> 00:45:26,260
Of course.

867
00:45:26,260 --> 00:45:26,760
goriest.

868
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:34,604


869
00:45:34,604 --> 00:45:40,130
I can now erase the, API.

870
00:45:40,130 --> 00:45:53,780


871
00:45:53,780 --> 00:45:57,290
Makes me think of
Google versus Oracle.

872
00:45:57,290 --> 00:45:59,180
And then following that case?

873
00:45:59,180 --> 00:46:02,278
Yeah, it's interesting.

874
00:46:02,278 --> 00:46:06,190


875
00:46:06,190 --> 00:46:23,590
OK pretty clear
this implementation

876
00:46:23,590 --> 00:46:26,360
is much more significant
than the API, but anyway.

877
00:46:26,360 --> 00:46:28,120
If

878
00:46:28,120 --> 00:46:30,190
First goal is to
prove log squared.

879
00:46:30,190 --> 00:46:31,840
This is just like a warm up.

880
00:46:31,840 --> 00:46:33,622
This is actually
trivial at this point.

881
00:46:33,622 --> 00:46:35,830
We've done all the work to
do a lot of squared bound.

882
00:46:35,830 --> 00:46:37,454
In fact, you just
replace the slay tree

883
00:46:37,454 --> 00:46:39,670
with a red-black
tree, and you know

884
00:46:39,670 --> 00:46:44,380
that each of these
operations is Log n.

885
00:46:44,380 --> 00:46:47,140
All displays that we do, I
mean, you can do essentially

886
00:46:47,140 --> 00:46:49,754
like a splay in a balance
binary [INAUDIBLE] tree,

887
00:46:49,754 --> 00:46:51,170
you can still move
it to the root.

888
00:46:51,170 --> 00:46:54,070
You can still maintain it
temporarily and maintain

889
00:46:54,070 --> 00:46:55,237
the height is order log n.

890
00:46:55,237 --> 00:46:56,320
That's one way to view it.

891
00:46:56,320 --> 00:46:58,652
Or you can observe the
splay tree analysis

892
00:46:58,652 --> 00:47:00,610
that gives you log n,
which we haven't actually

893
00:47:00,610 --> 00:47:02,140
covered in this class.

894
00:47:02,140 --> 00:47:03,520
Still applies in this scenario.

895
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:05,103
Even though it's not
one splay a tree.

896
00:47:05,103 --> 00:47:06,490
It's a bunch of trees.

897
00:47:06,490 --> 00:47:09,220
You can show each of the
splays is order log n.

898
00:47:09,220 --> 00:47:13,900
So what that gives you is that--

899
00:47:13,900 --> 00:47:18,285
so we have lets just say
it's order log n amortized

900
00:47:18,285 --> 00:47:22,680
per splay, a few splay trees
or use regular balancer

901
00:47:22,680 --> 00:47:24,690
trees is definitely log n.

902
00:47:24,690 --> 00:47:33,220
So then if we do m operations,
it's going to cost --we're not

903
00:47:33,220 --> 00:47:35,020
actually going to be done--

904
00:47:35,020 --> 00:47:41,680
order log n times
m plus total number

905
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:43,045
of preferred child changes.

906
00:47:43,045 --> 00:47:54,400


907
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:58,150
This bound should be clear,
because every operation reduces

908
00:47:58,150 --> 00:48:02,170
to accesses plus
constant amount of work.

909
00:48:02,170 --> 00:48:07,070
Maybe one more splay a
splay is just another log n.

910
00:48:07,070 --> 00:48:15,100
And the total number of
preferred child changes

911
00:48:15,100 --> 00:48:16,920
comes from this access thing.

912
00:48:16,920 --> 00:48:20,609
We're doing one splay per
preferred child change.

913
00:48:20,609 --> 00:48:22,150
So that thing is
reasonable, you just

914
00:48:22,150 --> 00:48:24,640
take it, multiply by
log n, we're done.

915
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:28,810
So the remaining thing is,
at this point, just claim.

916
00:48:28,810 --> 00:48:34,700
Total number of preferred
trial changes is order m log n.

917
00:48:34,700 --> 00:48:38,470
So if you take this
whole thing, divide by m,

918
00:48:38,470 --> 00:48:41,740
you get log squared amortize.

919
00:48:41,740 --> 00:48:44,380
So that sounds kind
of lame, log square

920
00:48:44,380 --> 00:48:46,847
is not such a good bound,
but it's a warm up.

921
00:48:46,847 --> 00:48:48,430
In fact, we need to
prove this anyway.

922
00:48:48,430 --> 00:48:50,090
We need this for
the log n analysis.

923
00:48:50,090 --> 00:48:51,640
So first thing
I'm going to do is

924
00:48:51,640 --> 00:48:56,020
prove total number of preferred
child changes is log squared.

925
00:48:56,020 --> 00:48:59,510
Before I do that, I need
heavy-light decomposition.

926
00:48:59,510 --> 00:49:02,140
So to prove, this we're going to
use heavy-light decomposition.

927
00:49:02,140 --> 00:49:04,223
And this I think, is where
things get pretty cool.

928
00:49:04,223 --> 00:49:22,440


929
00:49:22,440 --> 00:49:25,320
So heavy-light
decomposition, this

930
00:49:25,320 --> 00:49:30,280
is another way to decompose
a tree into paths.

931
00:49:30,280 --> 00:49:33,510


932
00:49:33,510 --> 00:49:35,250
So heavy-light
decomposition is, again,

933
00:49:35,250 --> 00:49:38,580
going to apply to
the represented tree.

934
00:49:38,580 --> 00:49:39,630
Not the tree of ox trees.

935
00:49:39,630 --> 00:49:42,930
It's like an intrinsic thing.

936
00:49:42,930 --> 00:49:47,340
It's very simple we define
the size of the node

937
00:49:47,340 --> 00:49:50,340
to be the number of
nodes in that subtree.

938
00:49:50,340 --> 00:49:52,740
We've done this
many times, I think.

939
00:49:52,740 --> 00:49:58,140


940
00:49:58,140 --> 00:50:04,560
And then, we're going
to call an edge from v

941
00:50:04,560 --> 00:50:14,150
to its parent heavy or light.

942
00:50:14,150 --> 00:50:23,020
It's heavy if the size
of v is more than half

943
00:50:23,020 --> 00:50:24,375
of the size of its parent.

944
00:50:24,375 --> 00:50:32,164


945
00:50:32,164 --> 00:50:33,580
And, otherwise,
it's called light.

946
00:50:33,580 --> 00:50:41,570


947
00:50:41,570 --> 00:50:45,640
OK, so we have parent
and sub child v

948
00:50:45,640 --> 00:50:47,990
has loads of other children.

949
00:50:47,990 --> 00:50:51,080
I just want to know, is the
heaviest of all your children?

950
00:50:51,080 --> 00:50:52,910
That's one way to define it.

951
00:50:52,910 --> 00:50:55,010
But, in, particular
is a bigger than half

952
00:50:55,010 --> 00:50:56,859
of the total weight of p?

953
00:50:56,859 --> 00:50:58,400
So there might not
be any heavy child

954
00:50:58,400 --> 00:50:59,608
according to this definition.

955
00:50:59,608 --> 00:51:01,700
Maybe it's nicely
evenly balanced.

956
00:51:01,700 --> 00:51:03,090
Everybody's got a third.

957
00:51:03,090 --> 00:51:05,540
But if somebody has got bigger
than 1/2, I call it heavy.

958
00:51:05,540 --> 00:51:06,620
Everybody else is light.

959
00:51:06,620 --> 00:51:10,490
So there's going to be, at most,
one heavy edge from every node.

960
00:51:10,490 --> 00:51:14,590
Therefore, heavy edges decompose
your world into path's.

961
00:51:14,590 --> 00:51:17,300
Heavy paths decompose the tree.

962
00:51:17,300 --> 00:51:28,730


963
00:51:28,730 --> 00:51:34,100
Nodes, every node lives
in some heavy path.

964
00:51:34,100 --> 00:51:38,840
It may be node has no heavy
childs, but, at most, one.

965
00:51:38,840 --> 00:51:43,010
This may seem kind of silly,
but in fact, because your maybe

966
00:51:43,010 --> 00:51:43,880
all edges are light.

967
00:51:43,880 --> 00:51:45,640
This might not do
anything, every node

968
00:51:45,640 --> 00:51:49,160
is in its own path, that's
actually a really good case,

969
00:51:49,160 --> 00:51:51,080
light edges are good.

970
00:51:51,080 --> 00:51:51,830
Why are they good?

971
00:51:51,830 --> 00:51:55,130
Because then the size of
v is at most half the size

972
00:51:55,130 --> 00:51:56,190
of its parent.

973
00:51:56,190 --> 00:51:58,640
I mean, every time you
follow a light edge,

974
00:51:58,640 --> 00:52:01,350
the size of your subtree
went down by a factor of 2.

975
00:52:01,350 --> 00:52:02,930
How many times is
going to happen?

976
00:52:02,930 --> 00:52:04,310
Log n times.

977
00:52:04,310 --> 00:52:07,430
Start with everything at
the root, as you walk down,

978
00:52:07,430 --> 00:52:09,980
if you're decreasing your
side effect or two every time,

979
00:52:09,980 --> 00:52:12,140
you can only follow log .

980
00:52:12,140 --> 00:52:13,740
Light edges.

981
00:52:13,740 --> 00:52:15,810
This is what we call the
light depth of a node.

982
00:52:15,810 --> 00:52:22,440


983
00:52:22,440 --> 00:52:29,545
This is the number of light
edges on a root to the path.

984
00:52:29,545 --> 00:52:38,070


985
00:52:38,070 --> 00:52:42,374
And it is always,
at most, log n.

986
00:52:42,374 --> 00:52:44,040
Now, remember heavy
edges could be huge.

987
00:52:44,040 --> 00:52:46,380
Maybe you follow, maybe
your tree is a path.

988
00:52:46,380 --> 00:52:47,940
Then every edge is heavy.

989
00:52:47,940 --> 00:52:53,580
And you n of them to
get from the root of v.

990
00:52:53,580 --> 00:52:55,480
So we can't bound the
number of heavy edges.

991
00:52:55,480 --> 00:52:59,760
But the number of light
we can bound as log n.

992
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:04,520
This is where heavy light
to composition is useful.

993
00:53:04,520 --> 00:53:06,324
So you've got preferred
path composition.

994
00:53:06,324 --> 00:53:08,490
Our Or data structure, we're
not going to change it.

995
00:53:08,490 --> 00:53:09,970
It's still following
the preferred path

996
00:53:09,970 --> 00:53:10,720
the decomposition.

997
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:13,350
But our analysis is going
to think about which edges

998
00:53:13,350 --> 00:53:16,830
are heavy and which are light.

999
00:53:16,830 --> 00:53:20,310
In general, an edge can
have four different states.

1000
00:53:20,310 --> 00:53:22,710
It can be preferred
or not preferred.

1001
00:53:22,710 --> 00:53:25,110
And it can be preferred
or not preferred,

1002
00:53:25,110 --> 00:53:27,020
it could be heavy or light.

1003
00:53:27,020 --> 00:53:29,050
All four of those
combinations are possible,

1004
00:53:29,050 --> 00:53:31,560
because one of them has to
do with the access sequence,

1005
00:53:31,560 --> 00:53:34,026
the other has to do with
the structure of the tree.

1006
00:53:34,026 --> 00:53:35,900
These are basically
orthogonal to each other.

1007
00:53:35,900 --> 00:53:38,588


1008
00:53:38,588 --> 00:53:44,610
OK, so let's maybe go here.

1009
00:53:44,610 --> 00:54:09,990


1010
00:54:09,990 --> 00:54:12,890
So next thing I'm going to do
is use heavy light decomposition

1011
00:54:12,890 --> 00:54:16,250
to analyze total number of
preferred child changes,

1012
00:54:16,250 --> 00:54:18,470
by looking at not only
whether an edge is preferred

1013
00:54:18,470 --> 00:54:20,600
or not, but whether
it is heavy or light.

1014
00:54:20,600 --> 00:54:23,960


1015
00:54:23,960 --> 00:54:32,775
We're going to get an order m
log n bound on preferred child

1016
00:54:32,775 --> 00:54:33,275
changes.

1017
00:54:33,275 --> 00:54:40,970


1018
00:54:40,970 --> 00:54:42,860
So here's the big idea.

1019
00:54:42,860 --> 00:55:29,970


1020
00:55:29,970 --> 00:55:33,990
In order for a preferred
child to change,

1021
00:55:33,990 --> 00:55:36,360
I mean when you change
for a child of one node

1022
00:55:36,360 --> 00:55:39,870
from this to this, I'm
going to think of this edge

1023
00:55:39,870 --> 00:55:42,270
as being destroyed
from its preferredness,

1024
00:55:42,270 --> 00:55:46,520
and this one is being created
in it's preferredness.

1025
00:55:46,520 --> 00:55:52,140
OK, so of course, if we could
count preferred edge equations,

1026
00:55:52,140 --> 00:55:56,940
that would be basically the
same as preferred child changes.

1027
00:55:56,940 --> 00:56:00,900
Or we could count preferred
edge destructions,

1028
00:56:00,900 --> 00:56:04,030
that would be basically, the
same as the number of changes.

1029
00:56:04,030 --> 00:56:05,610
OK, so that's the idea.

1030
00:56:05,610 --> 00:56:08,220
If you ignore this part, or
look at pilferage equations

1031
00:56:08,220 --> 00:56:09,480
or prefer it is destructions.

1032
00:56:09,480 --> 00:56:11,370
But then I also care
about whether that edge

1033
00:56:11,370 --> 00:56:13,890
is light or heavy.

1034
00:56:13,890 --> 00:56:16,530
So it turns out for
the light edges,

1035
00:56:16,530 --> 00:56:19,527
it's going to be easier to
talk about the creations

1036
00:56:19,527 --> 00:56:20,610
or to bound the creations.

1037
00:56:20,610 --> 00:56:22,310
For heavy edges is
going to be easier

1038
00:56:22,310 --> 00:56:24,360
to bound the destructions.

1039
00:56:24,360 --> 00:56:26,910
If I do both of those and
add them up, that in total

1040
00:56:26,910 --> 00:56:30,330
is, basically, the number
of preferred edge changes

1041
00:56:30,330 --> 00:56:32,460
according to whether
there is light or heavy.

1042
00:56:32,460 --> 00:56:35,200
You need to add in a
little bit more because

1043
00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:38,160
and edge might get created
but never destroyed.

1044
00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:41,310
And if it's heavy, then
it won't get counted here.

1045
00:56:41,310 --> 00:56:43,290
Or an edge might get
destroyed because it

1046
00:56:43,290 --> 00:56:45,600
exists originally,
never got created

1047
00:56:45,600 --> 00:56:47,309
but it got destroyed
over the operations.

1048
00:56:47,309 --> 00:56:49,558
And if it was light, then
it wouldn't be counted here.

1049
00:56:49,558 --> 00:56:51,480
So just add on n plus
1 for all the edges

1050
00:56:51,480 --> 00:56:53,100
might get a bonus point.

1051
00:56:53,100 --> 00:56:56,260
But, otherwise,
this will bound it,

1052
00:56:56,260 --> 00:56:58,345
it's going to look at
light edge creations--

1053
00:56:58,345 --> 00:57:01,800
creations, light preferred edge
creations, heavy preferred edge

1054
00:57:01,800 --> 00:57:02,954
distructions.

1055
00:57:02,954 --> 00:57:05,370
And it can be destroyed because
it becomes no longer heavy

1056
00:57:05,370 --> 00:57:06,990
or no longer preferred.

1057
00:57:06,990 --> 00:57:09,600
And it can be created
because it becomes light

1058
00:57:09,600 --> 00:57:12,810
or it becomes preferred and
was already the other one.

1059
00:57:12,810 --> 00:57:14,310
OK, so all we need
to do is think

1060
00:57:14,310 --> 00:57:18,510
about, in all these operations,
access link-cut, just

1061
00:57:18,510 --> 00:57:19,230
the updates.

1062
00:57:19,230 --> 00:57:21,720
So access link/cut.

1063
00:57:21,720 --> 00:57:23,850
How can this change?

1064
00:57:23,850 --> 00:57:24,975
So let's start with access.

1065
00:57:24,975 --> 00:57:30,180


1066
00:57:30,180 --> 00:57:33,060
So access.

1067
00:57:33,060 --> 00:57:33,690
The hard one.

1068
00:57:33,690 --> 00:57:37,620


1069
00:57:37,620 --> 00:57:39,820
Well, there's all
this implementation,

1070
00:57:39,820 --> 00:57:41,730
which is dealing with
the tree of ox trees,

1071
00:57:41,730 --> 00:57:44,100
but really, an access
does a very simple thing.

1072
00:57:44,100 --> 00:57:47,460
It makes the path from
the root to be preferred.

1073
00:57:47,460 --> 00:57:48,790
That's its goal.

1074
00:57:48,790 --> 00:57:52,920
So there's the root, it's
to v, this becomes preferred

1075
00:57:52,920 --> 00:57:54,630
whether it was before or not.

1076
00:57:54,630 --> 00:57:57,300
Some of it was before
some of it wasn't.

1077
00:57:57,300 --> 00:58:00,702
So some of these might
be on newly preferred.

1078
00:58:00,702 --> 00:58:05,630


1079
00:58:05,630 --> 00:58:07,820
It does not change which
edges are heavy or light.

1080
00:58:07,820 --> 00:58:09,350
It does not change the
structure of the tree

1081
00:58:09,350 --> 00:58:10,266
when you do an access.

1082
00:58:10,266 --> 00:58:12,740
Only link/cut changed the
structure of the tree.

1083
00:58:12,740 --> 00:58:16,010
So it makes some of
these edges preferred.

1084
00:58:16,010 --> 00:58:19,070
What that means, of course,
is that some other edges

1085
00:58:19,070 --> 00:58:21,770
used to be preferred and
are no longer preferred.

1086
00:58:21,770 --> 00:58:24,510
Those are the preferred
child changes.

1087
00:58:24,510 --> 00:58:27,140
So if we look at
this, first concern

1088
00:58:27,140 --> 00:58:29,620
is that we're creating
new preferred edges,

1089
00:58:29,620 --> 00:58:33,074
so maybe we create some
new light preferred edges.

1090
00:58:33,074 --> 00:58:34,490
How many new light
preferred edges

1091
00:58:34,490 --> 00:58:38,250
could we create along this path?

1092
00:58:38,250 --> 00:58:39,110
Most log n.

1093
00:58:39,110 --> 00:58:43,380
Whatever the light depth
of v is as an upper bound.

1094
00:58:43,380 --> 00:58:52,490
So make, at most, log
and, like preferred edges,

1095
00:58:52,490 --> 00:58:56,420
because they all live
on a single path.

1096
00:58:56,420 --> 00:58:58,430
And it would be really
hard to bound how many

1097
00:58:58,430 --> 00:59:01,050
heavy preferred edges we make.

1098
00:59:01,050 --> 00:59:02,050
But we don't have to.

1099
00:59:02,050 --> 00:59:04,460
We don't have to worry about
heavy preferred edges being

1100
00:59:04,460 --> 00:59:05,510
destroyed.

1101
00:59:05,510 --> 00:59:07,310
Now, those edges
could be these ones.

1102
00:59:07,310 --> 00:59:09,740
These edges used to be
preferred, now they're not.

1103
00:59:09,740 --> 00:59:13,610
If they were heavy, then
I have to pay for them.

1104
00:59:13,610 --> 00:59:17,420
But the number of these
edges is equal to,

1105
00:59:17,420 --> 00:59:19,310
or is at most, the
number of these edges.

1106
00:59:19,310 --> 00:59:21,890
I mean, if this edge
was heavy, every node

1107
00:59:21,890 --> 00:59:23,960
has only one heavy down pointer.

1108
00:59:23,960 --> 00:59:27,280
So if this edge is heavy hanging
off, then this one is light.

1109
00:59:27,280 --> 00:59:29,880
We know there's only
log n light edges here.

1110
00:59:29,880 --> 00:59:31,520
So the number of
heavy edges coming off

1111
00:59:31,520 --> 00:59:35,370
here can also be most log n,

1112
00:59:35,370 --> 00:59:43,740
So destroy, at most, log
n heavy preferred edges.

1113
00:59:43,740 --> 00:59:47,120


1114
00:59:47,120 --> 00:59:51,800
Yeah In some sense,
we don't even really

1115
00:59:51,800 --> 00:59:55,040
are about the word
preferred here.

1116
00:59:55,040 --> 00:59:57,900
But, of course, we're not
making them, light so anyway.

1117
00:59:57,900 --> 01:00:01,324


1118
01:00:01,324 --> 01:00:02,212
Is that clear?

1119
01:00:02,212 --> 01:00:04,670
Now, there's actually one more
edge that could change which

1120
01:00:04,670 --> 01:00:07,880
is, there used to be a preferred
edge from v, now there isn't.

1121
01:00:07,880 --> 01:00:11,220
We destroyed that in the very
beginning of the operation.

1122
01:00:11,220 --> 01:00:15,650
So maybe plus 1 that might have
destroyed one more heavy edge.

1123
01:00:15,650 --> 01:00:19,940
But overall order log n.

1124
01:00:19,940 --> 01:00:22,745
So, actually, really
easy to analyze access.

1125
01:00:22,745 --> 01:00:26,100


1126
01:00:26,100 --> 01:00:27,210
Any questions about that?

1127
01:00:27,210 --> 01:00:42,500


1128
01:00:42,500 --> 01:00:50,000
OK, link/cut not
much to say here.

1129
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:53,600
Yeah, so link/cut don't really
change what's preferred.

1130
01:00:53,600 --> 01:00:56,570
I'm analyzing-- I'm going
to think about what link

1131
01:00:56,570 --> 01:00:58,310
does after it accesses v and w.

1132
01:00:58,310 --> 01:01:00,710
Because access we've
already analyzed.

1133
01:01:00,710 --> 01:01:04,730
So link is just
these two operations

1134
01:01:04,730 --> 01:01:06,540
which add a single pointer.

1135
01:01:06,540 --> 01:01:10,760
So if you look at what that's
doing in the represented tree,

1136
01:01:10,760 --> 01:01:14,330
which was v was the
route and we made

1137
01:01:14,330 --> 01:01:22,490
it to be a new child w, which
lived in some tree over here.

1138
01:01:22,490 --> 01:01:24,365
That's in the represented
tree, what happens.

1139
01:01:24,365 --> 01:01:28,470


1140
01:01:28,470 --> 01:01:34,100
What happens is
that w gets heavier.

1141
01:01:34,100 --> 01:01:36,680
I guess also this get's heavier.

1142
01:01:36,680 --> 01:01:41,180
All the nodes on this route
to w path get heavier.

1143
01:01:41,180 --> 01:01:44,270
That's all that happens
in terms of heavy, light.

1144
01:01:44,270 --> 01:01:45,890
Preferred paths don't change.

1145
01:01:45,890 --> 01:01:49,870
It's just about heavy
and light changing.

1146
01:01:49,870 --> 01:01:52,850
OK, in fact, this will
be a preferred path

1147
01:01:52,850 --> 01:01:56,060
from the root to v because
we just accessed those guys.

1148
01:01:56,060 --> 01:02:02,640


1149
01:02:02,640 --> 01:02:06,670
So we're heavying edges,
which means you might create

1150
01:02:06,670 --> 01:02:09,010
new heavy preferred edges.

1151
01:02:09,010 --> 01:02:12,760
But we don't care about heavy
preferred edges being created.

1152
01:02:12,760 --> 01:02:16,580
We only care about
them being destroyed.

1153
01:02:16,580 --> 01:02:18,010
So has anything changed?

1154
01:02:18,010 --> 01:02:22,232
Well, there might have been a
heavy edge hanging off of here.

1155
01:02:22,232 --> 01:02:22,940
Is that possible?

1156
01:02:22,940 --> 01:02:26,550


1157
01:02:26,550 --> 01:02:29,640
Yeah, so this might turn
light, because this one

1158
01:02:29,640 --> 01:02:31,340
became heavier.

1159
01:02:31,340 --> 01:02:33,090
So this edge might
become light, which

1160
01:02:33,090 --> 01:02:36,180
means we might have
potentially lost--

1161
01:02:36,180 --> 01:02:38,430
this could have been
preferred before.

1162
01:02:38,430 --> 01:02:40,722
It wasn't preferred,
so who cares?

1163
01:02:40,722 --> 01:02:42,180
If we've already
done the accesses,

1164
01:02:42,180 --> 01:02:43,830
the edges are already
not preferred.

1165
01:02:43,830 --> 01:02:45,032
So not a big deal.

1166
01:02:45,032 --> 01:02:45,990
So can anything happen?

1167
01:02:45,990 --> 01:02:48,839
I think not.

1168
01:02:48,839 --> 01:02:50,880
Some of the edges on the
path might become heavy,

1169
01:02:50,880 --> 01:02:53,160
but we don't care because
they are preferred.

1170
01:02:53,160 --> 01:02:55,260
Some of the edges off the
path might become light,

1171
01:02:55,260 --> 01:02:57,260
but we don't care because
they're not preferred.

1172
01:02:57,260 --> 01:02:58,680
Done.

1173
01:02:58,680 --> 01:03:04,610
So this actually costs zero
in just analyzing number

1174
01:03:04,610 --> 01:03:05,860
of preferred child changes.

1175
01:03:05,860 --> 01:03:09,210
Cuts, not quite so simple.

1176
01:03:09,210 --> 01:03:13,450
When we do a cut,
we're lightning stuff.

1177
01:03:13,450 --> 01:03:16,530


1178
01:03:16,530 --> 01:03:19,550
The path from the root to
v in the represented tree,

1179
01:03:19,550 --> 01:03:23,580
when we line up there,
becomes lighter,

1180
01:03:23,580 --> 01:03:28,290
because we cut off that
whole subtree containing v.

1181
01:03:28,290 --> 01:03:33,210
So we might create light
preferred edges on that path.

1182
01:03:33,210 --> 01:03:35,470
And that's something we
actually want to count.

1183
01:03:35,470 --> 01:03:37,710
we count number of light
preferred edges created.

1184
01:03:37,710 --> 01:03:43,294
But, again, they're on a
path so it's, at most, log n

1185
01:03:43,294 --> 01:03:50,560
Most log n light
preferred edges created.

1186
01:03:50,560 --> 01:03:52,560
We don't care about edges
hanging off that path

1187
01:03:52,560 --> 01:03:54,143
because they're not
preferred anymore,

1188
01:03:54,143 --> 01:03:57,299
so it's nothing to talk about.

1189
01:03:57,299 --> 01:03:57,840
So that's it.

1190
01:03:57,840 --> 01:04:01,701
That proves m log n
preferred child changes.

1191
01:04:01,701 --> 01:04:04,200
It's amortized because we're
doing this creation/destruction

1192
01:04:04,200 --> 01:04:05,370
business.

1193
01:04:05,370 --> 01:04:08,720
This thing is worst case log n
per operation, this quantity.

1194
01:04:08,720 --> 01:04:10,890
But when you sum it
up, then you actually

1195
01:04:10,890 --> 01:04:12,880
get about the number of
preferred child changes

1196
01:04:12,880 --> 01:04:13,380
overall.

1197
01:04:13,380 --> 01:04:19,800


1198
01:04:19,800 --> 01:04:22,770
So if you plug that
into this bound,

1199
01:04:22,770 --> 01:04:25,020
we get a log squared m bound.

1200
01:04:25,020 --> 01:04:28,450
Big deal.

1201
01:04:28,450 --> 01:04:30,030
But with a little
bit more work, we

1202
01:04:30,030 --> 01:04:31,920
can actually get a log n bound.

1203
01:04:31,920 --> 01:04:39,840


1204
01:04:39,840 --> 01:04:41,280
For this, we need
to actually know

1205
01:04:41,280 --> 01:04:43,880
a little bit about
splay tree analysis.

1206
01:04:43,880 --> 01:04:46,436
I didn't cover in Lecture Six.

1207
01:04:46,436 --> 01:04:48,560
You probably would have
forgotten it by now anyway.

1208
01:04:48,560 --> 01:04:50,880
So let me give you
what little you need

1209
01:04:50,880 --> 01:04:54,180
to know about splay analysis.

1210
01:04:54,180 --> 01:04:57,930
First, I need to define a
slightly weird quantity.

1211
01:04:57,930 --> 01:05:00,600
It's kind of like
the weight of a node.

1212
01:05:00,600 --> 01:05:04,770
It's a capital W, but
a little bit weird.

1213
01:05:04,770 --> 01:05:20,600


1214
01:05:20,600 --> 01:05:23,640
OK, now we're thinking
about the tree of ox trees.

1215
01:05:23,640 --> 01:05:25,540
For the analysis we need that.

1216
01:05:25,540 --> 01:05:27,292
It's a tree of splay trees.

1217
01:05:27,292 --> 01:05:29,500
And what I'm looking at, is
in that tree of ox trees,

1218
01:05:29,500 --> 01:05:31,774
how many nodes are
in the subtree of v?

1219
01:05:31,774 --> 01:05:33,190
That's what I'm
going to call wv .

1220
01:05:33,190 --> 01:05:36,760
Whereas size of v was thinking
in the represented tree.

1221
01:05:36,760 --> 01:05:38,590
So this is a totally
different world.

1222
01:05:38,590 --> 01:05:41,050
Here, we're thinking about
the tree of ox trees.

1223
01:05:41,050 --> 01:05:44,640
So one way you can
rewrite this count

1224
01:05:44,640 --> 01:05:54,490
as the sum of all nodes w in
the ox tree containing v. It's

1225
01:05:54,490 --> 01:05:57,130
a weird notation, but look at
all the other nodes in the ox

1226
01:05:57,130 --> 01:05:59,417
tree--

1227
01:05:59,417 --> 01:06:00,000
is that right?

1228
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,642
Sorry.

1229
01:06:02,642 --> 01:06:03,142
No.

1230
01:06:03,142 --> 01:06:06,960


1231
01:06:06,960 --> 01:06:19,140
I should say w in v's
subtree in v's ox tree.

1232
01:06:19,140 --> 01:06:20,610
It's awkward to say.

1233
01:06:20,610 --> 01:06:24,930
What I mean is there is an
ox tree containing a node v,

1234
01:06:24,930 --> 01:06:28,650
and I want to look in that
subtree I'll know as w.

1235
01:06:28,650 --> 01:06:31,170
Just within the ox tree though.

1236
01:06:31,170 --> 01:06:35,700
And for all those nodes,
I take 1 plus the size

1237
01:06:35,700 --> 01:06:38,573
of ox trees hanging off.

1238
01:06:38,573 --> 01:06:46,970


1239
01:06:46,970 --> 01:06:48,770
So total number of nodes.

1240
01:06:48,770 --> 01:06:52,190
And when I say
hanging off I mean

1241
01:06:52,190 --> 01:06:54,930
via pathed parent pointers.

1242
01:06:54,930 --> 01:06:58,070
So down here, there are
trees, add up all their sizes

1243
01:06:58,070 --> 01:07:01,820
total number of nodes in
them, add one for w itself,

1244
01:07:01,820 --> 01:07:04,340
that's another way
of writing this.

1245
01:07:04,340 --> 01:07:10,910
I'll just mention that this
part is what's normally

1246
01:07:10,910 --> 01:07:12,530
considered in splay trees.

1247
01:07:12,530 --> 01:07:15,230
This is a bonus thing that,
basically, doesn't matter.

1248
01:07:15,230 --> 01:07:17,940


1249
01:07:17,940 --> 01:07:20,400
I'll justify that in a second.

1250
01:07:20,400 --> 01:07:21,980
So we define a
potential function

1251
01:07:21,980 --> 01:07:29,420
for our amortization fee, which
is sum over all nodes v of log

1252
01:07:29,420 --> 01:07:33,500
this quantity wv, this thing.

1253
01:07:33,500 --> 01:07:37,460
So just think of this
as an abstract quantity,

1254
01:07:37,460 --> 01:07:41,040
which for every node it has
some number associated with it.

1255
01:07:41,040 --> 01:07:45,200
Splay trees allow you to assign
arbitrary weight to every node,

1256
01:07:45,200 --> 01:07:48,350
use this potential function,
and prove abound --which

1257
01:07:48,350 --> 01:07:57,700
is called the access lemma
The access lemma says is that,

1258
01:07:57,700 --> 01:08:01,090
for this potential
function, the amortized cost

1259
01:08:01,090 --> 01:08:12,620
of doing a splay
operation splay of v,

1260
01:08:12,620 --> 01:08:30,290
is, at most, three times
log w of root of v's ox tree

1261
01:08:30,290 --> 01:08:38,029
minus log w of v plus 1.

1262
01:08:38,029 --> 01:08:41,000


1263
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:43,969
OK, so this is something
called the access Lemma

1264
01:08:43,969 --> 01:08:46,310
It's used to prove, for
example, that splay trees have

1265
01:08:46,310 --> 01:08:48,145
log n performance amortize.

1266
01:08:48,145 --> 01:08:49,520
It's also used to
prove that they

1267
01:08:49,520 --> 01:08:52,040
have a working set
bound, which you

1268
01:08:52,040 --> 01:08:54,229
may recall from Lecture Six.

1269
01:08:54,229 --> 01:08:57,040
But we never actually mentioned
the access lemma It's a tool.

1270
01:08:57,040 --> 01:08:57,979
It's an analysis tool.

1271
01:08:57,979 --> 01:09:00,950


1272
01:09:00,950 --> 01:09:04,266
This works no matter
how the w's are defined.

1273
01:09:04,266 --> 01:09:06,140
And remember, we're
thinking of splaying just

1274
01:09:06,140 --> 01:09:07,529
within a single ox tree.

1275
01:09:07,529 --> 01:09:10,069
So the size of the
ox trees hanging off

1276
01:09:10,069 --> 01:09:11,460
don't change during a splay.

1277
01:09:11,460 --> 01:09:13,500
They just come
along for the ride.

1278
01:09:13,500 --> 01:09:16,712
So the old analysis
of splay trees

1279
01:09:16,712 --> 01:09:18,170
I haven't proved
this lemma to you.

1280
01:09:18,170 --> 01:09:21,710
But it still applies
in this setting.

1281
01:09:21,710 --> 01:09:23,100
And given my lack of time.

1282
01:09:23,100 --> 01:09:25,880
I will just say in
words, the way you prove

1283
01:09:25,880 --> 01:09:27,800
this lemma is very simple.

1284
01:09:27,800 --> 01:09:30,229
You do you analyze each
operation of display

1285
01:09:30,229 --> 01:09:34,130
separately there's a zig-zag
case in a zigzag case.

1286
01:09:34,130 --> 01:09:39,500
And you argue that every time
you do such an operation,

1287
01:09:39,500 --> 01:09:44,240
you pay three times
a log of w of v

1288
01:09:44,240 --> 01:09:48,740
after the operation minus log
of wv before the operation.

1289
01:09:48,740 --> 01:09:51,680
So you just see how wv
changes when it goes up

1290
01:09:51,680 --> 01:09:55,155
after you do display
operation, and turns out it's

1291
01:09:55,155 --> 01:09:56,530
the most three
times log of that.

1292
01:09:56,530 --> 01:09:58,290
And it has to do with
concavity of log n.

1293
01:09:58,290 --> 01:10:00,650
It's just basic checking.

1294
01:10:00,650 --> 01:10:03,500
Once you have that you
get a telescoping sum.

1295
01:10:03,500 --> 01:10:07,820
Each operation is log
w new minus long w old.

1296
01:10:07,820 --> 01:10:13,070
Those cancel, in turn, until
you get the final log w of v,

1297
01:10:13,070 --> 01:10:17,720
minus the original log w of v.
The final log w is whatever--

1298
01:10:17,720 --> 01:10:21,510
I mean, v becomes the root and
so it has everybody below it.

1299
01:10:21,510 --> 01:10:24,440
So that's the axis lemma.

1300
01:10:24,440 --> 01:10:28,010
So assuming the
access lemma, I want

1301
01:10:28,010 --> 01:10:31,480
to prove to you a log n bound.

1302
01:10:31,480 --> 01:10:53,920
Maybe over here OK,
another thing to note,

1303
01:10:53,920 --> 01:10:57,430
when we change preferred
children, it does not affect w.

1304
01:10:57,430 --> 01:11:01,880
W defined on the
tree of ox trees.

1305
01:11:01,880 --> 01:11:03,800
If you turn a path
parent pointer

1306
01:11:03,800 --> 01:11:06,975
into a regular parent pointer
or vice versa, It doesn't care.

1307
01:11:06,975 --> 01:11:09,350
It looks the same from the
tree of ox trees' perspective.

1308
01:11:09,350 --> 01:11:12,609
All that changes, all that
matters is when you do splays

1309
01:11:12,609 --> 01:11:13,400
this stuff happens.

1310
01:11:13,400 --> 01:11:15,710
But the splay analysis
tells us how splays behave.

1311
01:11:15,710 --> 01:11:18,890
So we're kind of good.

1312
01:11:18,890 --> 01:11:25,040
If you look at what we did
over here, when we splayed v,

1313
01:11:25,040 --> 01:11:30,140
then we splayed w, then we did
a little bit of manipulation

1314
01:11:30,140 --> 01:11:32,820
which doesn't matter
in this analysis.

1315
01:11:32,820 --> 01:11:36,040
And then we splayed
v one more time.

1316
01:11:36,040 --> 01:11:38,780
How much does that cost
according to the access lemma.

1317
01:11:38,780 --> 01:11:43,220
It's basically going
to cost you order log

1318
01:11:43,220 --> 01:11:51,620
w of little w minus
log w of v plus 1,

1319
01:11:51,620 --> 01:12:00,410
because well is it clear?

1320
01:12:00,410 --> 01:12:03,830
When we do the first splay
of v going up to the root

1321
01:12:03,830 --> 01:12:07,460
that cost log of w of
the whole tree containing

1322
01:12:07,460 --> 01:12:10,070
b minus longer wv.

1323
01:12:10,070 --> 01:12:12,020
But if you just
look at log, I mean,

1324
01:12:12,020 --> 01:12:16,580
w is higher than the root of
v. So if we take a log of w

1325
01:12:16,580 --> 01:12:23,120
this the whole thing from w
downwards minus log wv, that

1326
01:12:23,120 --> 01:12:27,170
includes the cost that we did
for the initial splay of v.

1327
01:12:27,170 --> 01:12:30,530
Then when we played w, well
that's basically the same thing

1328
01:12:30,530 --> 01:12:32,090
but the next level up.

1329
01:12:32,090 --> 01:12:38,117
So if you look at log of w
minus log of w of next level up,

1330
01:12:38,117 --> 01:12:39,950
that's what it's going
to cost this splay w.

1331
01:12:39,950 --> 01:12:42,950
To splay v again, will
again cost this bound.

1332
01:12:42,950 --> 01:12:48,620
The point is, we sum this up
over all the preferred child

1333
01:12:48,620 --> 01:12:49,670
changes.

1334
01:12:49,670 --> 01:12:53,720
And what we get is a
telescoping scum again.

1335
01:12:53,720 --> 01:12:55,820
Same as in the display analysis.

1336
01:12:55,820 --> 01:13:03,290
So we end up with order log w
of everything, which an n minus,

1337
01:13:03,290 --> 01:13:05,480
I guess, the log of
w of the original v,

1338
01:13:05,480 --> 01:13:07,220
-but we don't really
care about that--

1339
01:13:07,220 --> 01:13:10,355
plus the number of
preferred child changes.

1340
01:13:10,355 --> 01:13:14,950


1341
01:13:14,950 --> 01:13:18,230
And now we're golden because
before, the obvious bound was

1342
01:13:18,230 --> 01:13:21,249
number preferred child
changes times again, now

1343
01:13:21,249 --> 01:13:22,790
it's number of
preferred time changes

1344
01:13:22,790 --> 01:13:25,790
plus log n for an entire access.

1345
01:13:25,790 --> 01:13:27,830
And so we pay log n here.

1346
01:13:27,830 --> 01:13:30,370
We already know the amortize
number preferred child changes

1347
01:13:30,370 --> 01:13:32,060
is log n per operation.

1348
01:13:32,060 --> 01:13:35,930
So overall the amortize
cost per operation is log n.

1349
01:13:35,930 --> 01:13:39,020
And we're done.

1350
01:13:39,020 --> 01:13:43,370
So I'll just mention the worst
case version of link-cut trees

1351
01:13:43,370 --> 01:13:47,060
instead of the amortize
splay based version.

1352
01:13:47,060 --> 01:13:49,710
They actually store the
heavy light decomposition.

1353
01:13:49,710 --> 01:13:52,430
They don't use preferred path
to decomposition at all, which

1354
01:13:52,430 --> 01:13:54,941
makes all the algorithms messy.

1355
01:13:54,941 --> 01:13:57,440
But you can just maintain the
heavy [? likely ?] composition

1356
01:13:57,440 --> 01:14:00,860
position dynamically as
the tree is changing,

1357
01:14:00,860 --> 01:14:04,610
and then you use a kind
of weight balanced trees,

1358
01:14:04,610 --> 01:14:09,470
like we saw in the
strings lecture, where

1359
01:14:09,470 --> 01:14:13,560
the depth of a node is sort
of related to log of its size

1360
01:14:13,560 --> 01:14:14,910
or inversely related I guess.

1361
01:14:14,910 --> 01:14:18,410
So you try to put all the
heavy things near the root,

1362
01:14:18,410 --> 01:14:20,450
because they're more
likely to be accessed.

1363
01:14:20,450 --> 01:14:22,940
And then you guarantee that
the overall tree of ox trees

1364
01:14:22,940 --> 01:14:27,500
has long n depth by skewing
each of the end of the ox trees

1365
01:14:27,500 --> 01:14:29,822
to match.

1366
01:14:29,822 --> 01:14:32,030
So it can be done but all
the operations are messier,

1367
01:14:32,030 --> 01:14:34,571
because you no longer have the
convenience of preferred paths

1368
01:14:34,571 --> 01:14:37,420
to make it easy to
